You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I probably am the author for children, over the United States.
And I'm always telling people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can think of it as a farmer, or with some leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany generally is something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle years in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to bleed up every week in the bathroom children, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me get to the bathroom in the teachers.
It made it in secret.
Three years old.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and <unk> and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call.
I'm <unk> that of adults never come to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to talk about this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> their family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman she wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed. It had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs to dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature, and everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can go fast, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water -- almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on a <unk> on another <unk> a year after a year.
They are born when they fall from the glaciers or they break off the ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, whereas others cannot be more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As it melts in a <unk> I'm breathing up its <unk> atmosphere.
As it melts, an iceberg releases freshwater rich minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it would be rid of the portraits of my ancestry, knowing that in these unique moments there are only going to be able to be able to exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice from the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to actually see an iceberg <unk>
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an average Greenland, iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby <unk> OK.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of yes, they're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome of sperm joins the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and you start life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity being turned two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training, and what I study in this case is the way people are <unk> the anatomy -- that -- of human bodies, and <unk> how they have considered the body fluid, the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with twins <unk> two people within one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of people with <unk> sex with individuals whose physics field doesn't fit into male and female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways to have a sex that doesn't be eaten in the male and male forms or female.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> <unk> and tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developing, following a course of typically female.
When you get a boy, the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a little boy, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes something that's happening.
After doing tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body something called areolar <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I think a woman <unk> doesn't know his <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman most women as I are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, she had girlfriend, and sex with her, he was wearing a life like a boy and just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the chromosomes <unk> and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with <unk> chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> that they have <unk> tissue, wrapped in tissue tissue.
We don't know well why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins or <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> to surgeries -- is not to be able to enjoy a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that it was <unk> to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy is bringing together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> being black wants to say, having African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when we present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people within a same body.
The most high case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we do the science, the more we need to admit that these categories -- that we thought were categories of stable <unk> which are stable <unk> <unk> <unk> -- are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in sexual terms.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What <unk> of the fact of the fact that they are just a few <unk>
And as we put in science in science, we get more and more in a rather awkward area where we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles of the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> <unk> today <unk> not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is dead.
Our ancestors had never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it yet.
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a prisoner's dilemma really death -- and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories could be attributed to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
We assume that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
It takes away from the idea of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first -- I have to admit that I'm a jury of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single time watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the translator, <unk>
Parents <unk> were, for me, the first activists of anatomy and tell you why.
What they did -- it was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as all of you remember, what our parents were, our parents know, was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that there was the political power of political power from the father of the father to the father and then the son, and so on.
Parents was rejected by rejected that idea and replacing it by a new concept, <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They took the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not differences -- that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time is <unk> science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations -- and therefore we would have the concept of being able to be transmitted by a <unk> idea of birth to birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at the example, the Declaration of Independence talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And it was a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And when we did, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about that way, but it was great.
And what did next?
And the women.
Then it came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that are going to <unk> <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start wondering why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we had to address anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years they should be allowed to have sex relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that to me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings who are <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before <unk> June 1, from 1980.
Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: <unk> of 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights for three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, to virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, for his hand, does not have the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still <unk> categories in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science came up so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy of the anatomy of the <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to get <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make tests on the practice of the people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you about the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I would be able to <unk> it offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks like <unk>
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to focus on this for people's rights to people, because I've been saying that I know some of the <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> smart decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people of 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured with an <unk> maybe with an <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that America is still driving this current thinking in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless it's willing to have a change of sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to light twins and then pick them out, and so they <unk> his fame.
But when the phone asked him, I asked the point of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And what I said, "Well, he's considered the political asylum instead of the <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who they are without <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we need to be the head.
Well, to conclude, I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about.
Since years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and working in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and dealing with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered as <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to see the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about the question, the more I think about it as a female thing in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain, and the male that makes us more attached to the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So even though the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people from the state, it's possible that they had more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we bring democracy beyond <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect bond, we think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth more than the cost of construction.
So we could easily get to the world <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just ran out of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners, and that the other half is still not allowed to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around the world have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distraction of the construction.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, build a whole apartment building, totally again, and when the rules of that place will be able to build <unk>
So I proposed that the governments to put together new education areas for big enough to contain cities and gave them a <unk> cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of <unk> Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> happened for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
And in the following presidential election, we were assigned to <unk> it <unk> with a platform in which we have <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this very complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and join all the current residents of apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to the new technologies, but you need so much of technologies as the norms of norms for <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us <unk>
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about valuable things that are the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And he used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> that in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was one pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> <unk>
And the talk was describing in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going on and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I was called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country goes forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk with data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport is covering over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to be able to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the distance.
And they also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> they would need help from countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily be a few thousand square miles.
And a little bit later, 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that could create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just moved through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional constitutional <unk>
All of the <unk> all of the features in society, <unk>
<unk> in the constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 was approved again in another voting voting to <unk>
Immediately after 21 at 21 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in the world of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big city center that's building in Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years to get the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to <unk> and eventually it would be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing her Supreme Court to allow the last Supreme Court to be the last of the new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of residents.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to go back to their family to go to get a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to make money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What would you think about insist for families to choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends asked me to say, "Thank you TED "Thank you.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what in the inside, I'm going to do a public confession -- and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find this and more recently, photographing and publish and publish on my blog and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money is going to a good <unk> -- my aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
I love <unk>
cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would say to this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
<unk> inside to exactly one week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after coming here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as a woman walking for TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you about some of the lessons that believe that, or not, I've learned in this adventure not to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You can almost always see <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including the <unk> and it was the most expensive thing that I've used in a week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be bad humor, when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not only do you <unk> you will also give you <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child you're going in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost safe that you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inner and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody to this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth of six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people came up with me this week just because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to find this stuff, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, and <unk> and bright <unk> if there's a little love in my heart, and I come back.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split up in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive side.
So if you get a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This is totally intuitive.
So where are your brain on this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see how <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed with the age of the years is that one thing that is saying that one thing can be only at one place at the time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, it always was <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar in parking and taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car bars playing with these strange tiny particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of things that are really rare -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, it was the physics few years -- you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes they play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, never had seen a <unk>
But it didn't fit my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so I should not all follow all the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why I should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little little bit of metal <unk> with a springboard and that stands out on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum side, but it needs a little bit of aid.
Let me make an analogy.
You know what awkward is being on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people goes up to do those things, because I don't want them to show you, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues with inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
So we would take the lights out, then they would take a <unk> and pull it all the air, and then we would get it to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute <unk>
Now, when you're only in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as I want.
So we measure their movements.
We found it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way that it was <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when I gave it a smooth drive, we were able to make it <unk> and you didn't get to <unk> at the same time -- something that is only happening with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down to the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which once means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one single atom -- and that piece of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my logic part that we talk about.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of history.
And this is when we turned it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw the metal followed there in one piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator -- actually only are quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about what quantum mechanics is that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, you literally define who you are. And that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and it took me 18 months.
Lots of negotiations and stories, they were going to do it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explains just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go at museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than it shows the demo to then explain a couple of interesting things that we've done from the launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around every museum that's there.
There's the gallery <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, in <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move out there and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with one click of it, we jumped inside.
They're inside, which wants to go at the end of the hall, themselves.
But go forward. That is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came in and found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a bit of a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called the <unk> which is about hitting a <unk> with a stick, the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further up and you'll see that you can really get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take off the image, so you'll see really what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're rapidly going to jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up, and it really makes it <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk>
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time from <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that is the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked inside, and I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just made a zooming around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice to your artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "You guys have this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian, all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something really interesting about <unk> dollars one in the last two decades.
A long time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, you would take a budget and put it to a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> control control control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now the interesting thing is that the real-time control systems are beginning to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're going to be <unk> computers.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex -- but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for the late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
So in a way, it's like almost all of the atoms in the way that they were <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> <unk> says that at the end of the hammer took the hammer, and he threw it on the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> dent and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment, and it would push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer, in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity on the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The time of time is on the top.
For the early afternoon, there are people over here and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a fast call to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> time <unk>
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night they all went to the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day they all went to the center of the University and the first minister of the time.
And then the whole world.
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but about things we use and consume.
We now know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, you know, how it's <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one <unk> <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we dropped not not disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we dropped a day is still still there.
And if we showed that to people, then we will be able to promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, bind to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> tubes of <unk> <unk> which opens and <unk>
It creates a <unk> <unk> with pixels of water.
If you get pixels the pixels can be written in them, showing patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can go into the image.
We introduced this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to the <unk>
We call it a <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows, but when you get up to it it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when the ceiling, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture is gone.
This is actually working.
You see people <unk> through what's going on in.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> at testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump out of <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and every one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves into space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw earlier, that moves with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud, we could form this.
A flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the language position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the appears appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D, where you can get anywhere, and you can see it from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with a entry that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best memory dancers of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use them as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
You can get the whole movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment as an oyster nursery like a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make it all <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world of the <unk> of the <unk> the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How will you move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made out of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel already.
You can move inside the inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, as a new top of London.
You can go out there in there.
As a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they might be able to make it better for a more accurate accurate accurate accurate accurate accurate accurate accurate accurate accurate accurate advantage.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure with yourself.
How about living with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is you going to do?
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of us -- that makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED Conference but I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay called <unk> in biology, makes sense of the light of <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: It's about the past, or the future?
It refers to others or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, good at one end, is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here for a few <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in its most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same <unk> <unk> which comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> gives you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully controversial environment for those bacteria.
It's warm down, dark rooms is very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that you can want to want no effort in their part.
It really is a quick pathway for bacteria with occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the way.
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us in certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something probably better <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I just <unk> college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental to me -- most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when organisms happen, things start to change.
It goes into the scene sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> seemed a lot of reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their years.
And one night someone hits his hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a gorgeous black dancer of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Well, she says, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted we to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about changing the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let them fall into the sea.
I think you all <unk> the feeling that I put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want immortality through my work.
I want to be <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily help longevity.
It doesn't necessarily help the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest of the smart.
Evolution encourages the best creatures to be adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish that were there -- fish -- <unk> -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this, when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look ahead and go to the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've got a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning is that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and spread from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it's no longer possible to have the amount of property that is happening to happen.
A second possibility is that you get an evolution of the natural type of natural type, bottom-up forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll away, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we were <unk> when distant planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, one possibility -- intriguing and scary.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, they're making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Just think that if you could be able to choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or <unk> or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
Don't want to make those changes in their genes.
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost at a cost at 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot of us to make the human genome reality, and it will be increasingly at the scope of all of us.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity to other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu flu in cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today, and in the future it's going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life to eliminate diabetes, eliminating the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want any more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology -- that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could take it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could be 100 thousand years old, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe occur within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices in making a better society, more successful society.
Or, we're going to choose <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust, and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and <unk> the wisdom required to make these <unk> decisions.
For bad or for bad, and before what I could make these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine making <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight flight.
And so he looked at it, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had had <unk> the airplane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot with the Hudson River.
Mostly it's not the road.
We cut the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words have ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to and I didn't, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is when you put the bridge George Washington, that I wasn't very much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give up to my ego.
And I am sorry the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who know matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as I got into that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mind clock is going to <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to break up in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, Wow, it's dying is not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that our entire life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness will become a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  --  And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
I was awarded a miracle of not dying that day.
And it was awarded me another gift that was the possibility of looking at the future and going back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please not be so -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What is it that you think they are still expecting because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the greatest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk>
One day he came to her home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today we have a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "Let's give them this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> saw Stephen <unk> not that all the people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone who is important and having a really good one, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Someone saw the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, you're going to pick up with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I had her brother with her brother and her father there at that very moment, <unk> OK, this is the Tony <unk> going to speak, we will build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get it back to the art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inner cannot <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer.
So you go around with art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with the sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks of Bush and, in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move the things from one side to another one, we had a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine to be able to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't do it. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> world to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the back garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and when they were <unk> they would have taken the squares off the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> walk of <unk> my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> walk of <unk> Beach, some wire wire and things of Home <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, we put it up on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up, we published the code -- the software will be low in free.
And we created a device that doesn't have any limitation at all.
There is no insurance company.
There is no hospital that can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicating using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the next room and this is his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning -- two weeks of programming all the night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed to that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the New hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and he would get me out there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the center of the <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to have an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you look at something that isn't possible, do it possible.
None of what there's in this room was possible -- stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology, I just recognized something and taught me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel that we have to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations often very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to eat only this fun -- fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in very awful situations.
So when I knew that I was going to come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of our ear, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an argument in <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TED Talk, of 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous for you or your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights for the name.
If you had asked me a year ago I would not have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been involved in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could be <unk> for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that I treat <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all film is <unk> <unk> of products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is all up at the bottom, from beginning to the end, it has brand images all the time; from the <unk> that shows before the title, the X-ray brand.
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> at the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more for <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X mark on the title, but we're going to make sure that all the categories that we could in the film.
You may take a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe you have <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in the largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> of "The largest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then besides showing you the brands as part of life, making it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and we actually showed the full process of how it works.
The point of the film is the transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help me help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear it -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how much it's going to be the people there.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money does to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> -- John <unk> -- I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth trying to convince a couple of big ones.
You know, whoever knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a whole bunch of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be powerful.
MS: But it's going to be hard for <unk> or being I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So, I am <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where she go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly gone.
None of us had nothing to do with this movie.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to have that new vehicle worth that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this one.
Actually, no, there was no such thing.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are three.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in practical practices -- the last line is probably the last line perhaps the largest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to the fact that it really changes all the time.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>   like that weird bear that still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want to be <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would get me in a lie -- and that's he looking at him as he used <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take away from my own team.
So what I started to figure out all of a sudden -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant films and others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the <unk> brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can tell you good enough for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to get you up.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there would be one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have a lot of man for man like <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a little bit of <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the smallest type of films that we have, we are rather a brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind us to <unk> people is the reason that this interests us.
MS: What words were using to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new. <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do we keep ourselves cool more time? With better <unk> <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common type.
I need to talk to the man from the street, the people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good job.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk> <unk>
<unk> A little bit of <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like that.
They are usually dressed as a sun, or I like the <unk> and the similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand -- it could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of a <unk> part of <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is dates because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I am <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but I often miss the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone to go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of it.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we are looking at the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come in, and they start in a place and in my case when we started and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to <unk>
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me of the <unk> to tell us about that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid of what type of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience, <unk> Great <unk> A: <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality personality, the Morgan <unk> brand is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies only get into one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focusing on the other.
A lot of companies tend to be able to avoid the things that they are not <unk> they are preventing fear, those elements -- and you're actually supporting them, and you make something positive for you, and you're nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful brands and conscious brands -- those things that have been and come and come up but a <unk> brand is something pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to ask your identity to brand, your brand personality brand, what would that be?
Are you a <unk> <unk> You're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or you are more well a attribute of <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful going to be cool like the <unk> contemporary <unk> or fearless as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or you are more of attribute <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
Are you -- traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are safe, stable, powerful, safe, sacred <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how we are now using the MRI of the brain to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for a film for movies.
We went to San Paulo where the informal to the <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> there is no <unk> anything.
And we went to districts that companies are getting a way into schools with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I've had the greatest answer or that I've been more successful is those ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it gone? They had success?
Well, since the film was sent in the <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies that we talked about, they gave their customers not to be <unk>
I've always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunity.
I think when you get people out to the people that are pushing the failure.
I think that when you train their employees in loss aversion to risk is preparing to all of your company <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, move forward, I think we need to give to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been presented for my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So let's call it on behalf of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket, I have a check to the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my attention for TED year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus in a portable computer used for an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> enter the gray box, damage the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you about how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> boxes.
So that called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat in which he didn't like our <unk> the wave, but he didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if you find a specific <unk> and even if the program that is trying to infect it is effectively working on that place.
If it doesn't, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
What would you better do the goal soon.
And then we pulled out the attack, and we found out the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two hot bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had all of the internal information.
They were all about the ones that attack.
You probably know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you about how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at is called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to do it with the real world with potential goals in the real world.
We need theories about <unk> that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> must be a white valuable, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>
There are not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and the power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went to an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that part of a mobile part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to do it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to decipher the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and its structures.
So, for example, the number <unk> <unk> out in that code, you can't <unk>
I started investigating a scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they are <unk> in what's called a <unk> and a waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it became better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
And so I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been familiar with several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends, and we had to start again.
And yet, we found out that both digital <unk> would tell one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some really interesting things that we saw -- really <unk>
There's the grey box, and it looks at the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values of sensors and the sensors sensors and the vibration sensors and provides <unk> code, which still runs through the attack, with fake data <unk>
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's kind of like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
So for example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes down, you have to open tubes on a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make a human operator, a human.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a automobile factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this payload with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are a large number of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better than we start to prepare right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK. Do you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give <unk> skills or another one that will make users of chairs in the wheels and get up and come back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that goes in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is also increasing your speed, and help, for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect it with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a 45 kilos, and it's getting <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> Human Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can give it 90 kilos for light on a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run a big <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where do I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of chairs of wheels on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people in the chairs of wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people, with damage in the spinal cord than when their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is added very quickly.
His only choice, a lot of times -- for a brain injury, or some another, that's the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago who had a injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years old, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It has some sensors.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer computer, here on the back.
There's also a few batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it going on with this soft and very natural path.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything <unk>
Shortly after, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never will go back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole my last little bit of hope from my self.
The technology of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs to <unk> it costs rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have the whole potential here to change life to future generations -- not just by soldiers, but to all of the users of chairs of the wheelchair, all of us all.
AB: Thank you.
I just return from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say, hi, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild <unk> of rainforests in the rainforests of the areas.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> society is now in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where death is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario in a violent conflict that has been shaped for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction also puts up the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of flesh and deforestation are making you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly we're not any of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear that laughter is hidden laughter the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not the <unk> because they have frequent <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish ties and foster the <unk>
We learn <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
Play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the play game, you see the <unk> roots of laughter, the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos on the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball, and I don't speak football game.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what he is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "It has <unk>
I just believe that in this case he likes it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in bonobos as in humans.
And this kind of video really is interesting because you know, this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing a unusual elements of the game elements -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust, and <unk> the <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that, sometimes we played alone, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and out there.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we need to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes a world that changes we have to play.
But we're going to get the most of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans -- life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate play, they can be the moments that it's the most urgent thing.
For that, fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we improve creativity, and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a body of fire fire volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are attributed to a highly skilled staff one has to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a race standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- first to the captain and he asked him to go up and would save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I walked into a <unk> building to save a live alive because it won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to join the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and it brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire department -- that at the most or less had finished off the fire and went into the main room in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking: but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the ladder where I met my <unk> and the precious dog in the front door.
<unk> out of the house the treasures for the house owner where, as he would expect, his treasure. got a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house owner of the <unk> <unk> by the brave to be able to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the rest was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling as a voluntary firefighter -- I'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of the <unk> of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made it, or are the <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't know.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained to <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, she comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules that fit into a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the largest construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the brick brick came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 <unk> per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much bigger and more complex circuits at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are going to be quiet to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together with magnets together.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
The bricks have a code in colors.
The green is the region, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with a green and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue one with a green make light.
Can we put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a <unk> button that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
<unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have an noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make <unk> faster or more slow, just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a growing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get into bricks and <unk>
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light works at night, or why the door of an elevator gets open or how a iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any experience in electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, which have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper and we said, "Give me something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is us.
So forward and <unk>
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to engage in the environment to focus on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue better with the video to a side of it.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I read the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of returning to Third World we send them to the wild world <unk>
They made great <unk> worked with employees <unk>
His job is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> to <unk>
The city of the city of Boston.
Here's how if you find a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody else is going to clean up when you stay caught by snow because you know it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, we had a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that the citizens were going to be able to <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did as any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you did, you put a name, in this case he put <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component of playground.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the youngest of the 21 apps <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
It extends into viral ways.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app realized that he could use it not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk>
That's why you ask the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to get people to stand up to clean up sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that are going to use using it.
And this has spread out without <unk> in organic and nature.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't normally happen.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that it was done by the normal channels there would be taken at least two and side of two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the California power of California that to the moment, 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days and it spreads in viral way is a kind of shot from warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the world's best ways to work, not as a lot of people as a lot of people think it should be.
Nor do a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
That is to say, without <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way of dealing with the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a collective problem problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very big community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people in the entire country that contribute to applications to <unk> every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a lot of frustration in the way, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we lost from view.
And that is that if we left the feelings about politics, a row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy -- the government is, in essence, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because I don't know.
Now, a lot of people have left the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately grows from -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to pick up people in order to make it <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the health care center of services and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark it in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, and put music very strong and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
They don't have that app.
It was the work of very clever people from the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened to get this <unk> <unk> in my garbage garbage -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I gave back the <unk> I went home.
Good nights. <unk> <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government income to collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government like platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to help and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role in it.
He connected to the two people.
And it could have been connected to the government services of being necessary but neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When one neighbor helps another, they will save the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen to a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is going to be <unk> our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface of 15 <unk>
So below this is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> which keeps us that we have to be designed as something that is operating on our against, that other thing, and we are losing the power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
<unk>
It's a team of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed set of <unk> report in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> on the financial reform.
That is not political activism -- it's <unk> activism.
And for the ones that we have told us about government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go to the <unk> the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We cannot without government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function in the way the government function in a way that can be expanded to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to <unk> I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who is going to come from, they're going to talk about.
They can express your opinions in any channel.
So when you face the government problem you don't really care how much your voices.
They're using their hands.
They set out the work to program applications that make a better job for government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out of <unk> <unk> <unk> a garbage dump that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, not only we are consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we will be a crowd, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and in death row.
I've spent the most part of my life in <unk> communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that you tell here have impact all over the world.
On occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning of meaning.
A doctor can do good, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the law, my job.
I learned about my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
He was daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born over the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, she was approaching me and I gave a good hug.
I was so strong I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would return to <unk> I was approaching and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I would go back again and if I was saying yes, I was in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, and I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At the beginning I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at it, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, he took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside, and he said, "I will tell you something, but you can't tell it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I was <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you are."
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "What first I want you to do is you want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to ask me is that you are always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought I thought I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to do is I want you to never be <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural South, I have a older brother a year older and one older year.
When I was 14 -- 15, a day my brother came home with a six <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk> of the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All you go, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing that we are.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens?
I looked at it with the force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I mean by the power that it has identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe that we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My girls died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to her, we had to <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, poor communities, it's so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of three blacks between 18 and 30 years is in jail or in parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, in 50 to 60 to 60 to every young color of color are in jail or in parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that is much better about if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth that defines the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at in our work some pretty curious developments here.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as other states, you care about rights for always if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the water loss of rights will be as high as it was before they were before you get the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where to 13 years old, to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without chance to go out.
Now we are in some <unk> process.
The only country in the world.
They went to people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they've been able to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding if people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty is defined by mistake.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent who is innocent and released from the death row.
One rate of error, <unk> an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation it would not be allowed ever to fly airplanes if every nine that you would have had been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
And it's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was kind of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are more people going to come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach you, you teach me <unk> <unk> to people who stop saying that in our history, for the first time with the <unk> after the <unk>
They ask me to say, <unk> <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with <unk> and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood what we've historically done before.
All of the time we went to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
We have a job to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage themselves with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> segregation without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's okay to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> We have no death penalty in Germany.
<unk> we could never get it here."
The room was silent and one lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we could never get in the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, and <unk> and <unk> we put them to run people."
<unk> about this.
How do we feel about a nation where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we really don't care about these very difficult, things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
Are we fascinated by technology <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
We talked about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
And if you think about them it is, in a way, something that is within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to intellectual stuff.
It comes with innovation, and development is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not only in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, an will to be in places of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege that I had a very young lawyer as a young lawyer of meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> was called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> We're going to get them back to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when I <unk>
<unk> <unk>
So I was going, and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let's try and say, "Now, let's try to tell you what that idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death penalty people.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and I ended up and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> got a finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very but very <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true to everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge for our technology, by our designs, not by our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich and powerful rich and <unk> but the way they treat the poor, people <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> for 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so they were adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what isn't it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a boy.
And one night I was awake <unk> God, if the judge can become something you don't, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 years old, a tiny, <unk> black.
I started to work in the <unk> with a <unk> that said, <unk> for my black client in 14 years is treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> executive of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put some <unk> conduct in <unk> at the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there's no ethical but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking about that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, I said, "My God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
And eventually I went down in the car, walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man, <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who are you?"
And I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you?" I said yes.
So I came up with me and <unk>
And I was looking at the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
When he walked in, the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity to <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> me." And we started myself."
People started to go. Everyone was <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
And they got the policemen the policemen with the <unk> <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all annoyed because we're talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I was going to see the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
I looked at the window, and I would try to hear all that <unk>
I would walk up to you and to get there.
Finally, this old black man, with a face of worry, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> assistant I showed himself upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> on the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man who keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of all, to those of all, that they share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see a very obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several times close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort for <unk> the funds that are spending today in politics today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funding to get the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There has been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones who think this is?
<unk> Actually, the death rate of violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes of violence.
It's by the wrong war against drugs.
That's why it comes up with this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain to steal a bicycle, by small crimes against their property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about today here.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for bin Laden.
<unk> 2: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: The police will throw blood gas.

Oh my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media would prefer <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all of the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So for a <unk> of stories, looking at the negative.
That old saying by the <unk> "If there are blood blood, it's very true.
And because every digital device gives us a negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, is no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe instead what happens is we got <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress ever done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change -- the species, the scarcity of species, the scarcity of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings we are very good at <unk> the problems and in the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average per capita income.
Child mortality has shrunk by 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
Charles <unk> that the world's literacy spent 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people are doing it.
And we follow <unk> <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., a lot of the people who live under the poverty line, have electricity, water, toilets, air television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the past, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So you know, a lot of this is the technology and lately, this exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price of the price at about 12 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and cheaper than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, how soft is -- in good and bad time, in the war and in peace -- in peace and <unk>
It's the resulting end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And in this curve, it comes from Moore's Law, there is a series of incredibly powerful technologies that we have.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computer, sensors and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production on all the planet, synthetic biology, fuel fuels and the food, the synthetic medicine, the fuels and the <unk> the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk> the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk> the digital medicine -- the <unk> and the
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline you would <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect positively <unk> the lives of a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
We can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean create life <unk> for every single inhabitant on the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that out <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of Washington is from aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure metal thing.
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's get this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity of energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the fact of the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, the solar electricity will cost six cents a <unk> for hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars about water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager space to the Earth, in 1990, after I went to <unk>
<unk> a big <unk> <unk> How did it go?
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but also here's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
<unk> nanotechnology, <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen in this morning, one of the innovators from <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water from any source of any source -- saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought that I will make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation by this technology that is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that Lakota warrior has better mobile communications communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And of course, with a smart phone with Google, he has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton did 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video -- <unk> images, libraries of books and music, technology, <unk> technology, <unk> <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing is going to get when the health applications are going on.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, Foundation something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams of the world to get these technologies into a mobile device with the one that they talk about, and because it has <unk> they can <unk> you can get blood of your finger.
To win has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is about 25 percent, and there are health workers.
When this device had a RNA virus or DNA that doesn't be <unk> to call the <unk> and first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it a billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just moved the brand seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it's about two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you want? What desires.
And instead of economic collapse. We will have the largest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of Academy and due to the use of impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three million more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
What about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the defenseless, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What <unk> these 3,000 billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that little, guided teams for his passion with a goal of course, can do things -- things that could only make great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game that people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how we fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined together, and they began to <unk>
And it has been shown to be shown today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power today as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we are going to get together to work on the solution of the great challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, like you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it very much to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the <unk> Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures are still saying they follow <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could be able to <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 centimeter the black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was more than the average in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
They went to five inches.
We would have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1950s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe made a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was forced to impose to countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly, it was called <unk> four.
So I went out to fish in it, and we ran in studies in the southern Sea of China -- and mostly in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> I know now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured was <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny blobs on <unk> remains fish from coral reef.
In short, the sea fund came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing community.
The background is going to be a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead.
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area that they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember.
So we got the starting point to start the start, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis -- we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, number of whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the <unk> images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end, keeping a few <unk> remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies kill animals without knowing what they've done until about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very diverse -- before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose a little bit of hot animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a benefit of good fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
And over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And it will do it because the evidence presented in a way earlier is not the way that they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like captain and just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the huge paper that can be a protected area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
And we would find the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a marine protected area and can benefit from the vision to <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you might have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were <unk> with the movie <unk> talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is Cameron <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional fashion.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are making viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the online video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can have been famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of course, only a little percentage is viral gets lots and lots of <unk> and makes a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> of trends, and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of the past summer.
<unk> was not proposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow as long.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> that I would send the video to the popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> we present new things and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, and I have to start on a Friday.   Everyone wants to come up with a weekend, the weekend.            -- on a Friday.  KA: Don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> Black is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be emerged from nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, is true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, he took a lot of <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of Science <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of bloggers will embrace a view of view and share it with a broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big joke in the inner joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's like this, that's it.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that that is weird, you know there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of the old one.
And then they made it up.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen from being a dumb joke to something that we can all form part of it.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted the <unk> <unk> or <unk> Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could you have to have written this <unk>
In a world where two days of video goes up two days of video per minute, just the only thing and unexpected can be able to get rid of the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really interested in very much.
Casey <unk> They <unk> <unk> by <unk> but often there are obstacles that are going to be controlled properly by <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise of the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million watched and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth all new that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend and creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media, of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience which defines the popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin <unk> began on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media features, it's just the current means of the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only one of unit and freedom in his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time, friends, now I get it.
It will be <unk> in silence.
He died broken by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be treated but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life was destined for a <unk> task that his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> four years that challenges the fiction, a boat goes into the dressed in the dressed of ship <unk>
All adults know the risks.
The greatest fear of the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were first <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast horizon and empty horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were fooled with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I know the lights from the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and he was going to finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple I did, given for the men of the platform.
None of the apple had then the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb whose population is made of immigrants from immigrants from immigrants to it.
Unlike the middle of the middle class -- whose existence I was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that come from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English is <unk> among people who had one thing in common. They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT to <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they set up an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, you wouldn't mind what was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs in middle of school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform, until the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there were <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my job was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry and <unk> and <unk> boys were trapped between two worlds.
It was <unk> and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was an classical <unk> student, relentless with what I think of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of a <unk> they chose me the young Australian man in the year.
And I was a piece of one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't be <unk>
A <unk> <unk> <unk> was now <unk> refugee and activist and <unk> invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when she gets into the ship.
"no" had ever been an option.
He said to me, "What do you not be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was, the more I was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were going to do, living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay on a <unk> race.
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a <unk> new <unk> in the scene -- and not just it's good, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave the enough steps out of my happy place to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> optimism -- a rare mix and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for whom the slogan cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant array of soup that all <unk>
They went down to the night of the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before finally, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused an <unk> to the <unk> and he took the cause she itself, and so much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can actually be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell stories and we make sure that we were still with it.
At night a <unk> came and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
He asked her to <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have the <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who were and how life built, we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that to you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of easy, the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, it will go up in brave every wave, the <unk> pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them a safe and look at it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of course, is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation of how nothing changed from the time of the ancient Indian <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car, <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And in that time when <unk> the great Prince Indian, Indian <unk> was <unk> he took a bow and with a <unk> to the ground, he got water.
Now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced with magic.
And that was a great deal.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I get this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to be <unk>
My grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones, and the camera clocks and the cameras can prevent them from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I got up, I threw up this technological world to see how it can use to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book, you know.
Where are we from.
They collect the text with the image, it animation, sound and touch.
The storytelling becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is a <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character in the book.
In a number of moments I get a <unk> the iPad knows where I live with GPS -- that comes out to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned to me exciting.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And they actually light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy was <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag up with this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In every fantasy book, there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain dots in the book, they also get <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content, and in a contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we're bringing them back in a <unk> child story.
In a story that comes current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the past 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that we have to go outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual to get out and in a chapter, they would take a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of photos that then can put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic and the Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on, and through augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inside of the home.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves with it.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where the forces of nature will relate to technology and magic and technology and technology is coming to each other.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We are getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and love love that we sit together with a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a law of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest issues for what all of us, or perhaps not all of the projects of <unk> they fail, they fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I get <unk> send my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem problem is not at the same time when it needs <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but he would see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over four Twitter Twitter on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available from the next week.
This little <unk> attached to an iPhone or another device.
And people were born from their homes, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they return to <unk> and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face is the firing of the costs of attention, <unk> <unk> and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did is to share it with you with a video.
We all have checks in <unk>
We may even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where ATM machines are <unk>
Where are you all <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked us, but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves life right now.
What we did was to do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> please see <unk> where, when it is open, because it turns out sometimes you open up at <unk> and other are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we would like to <unk> globally.
We are attached to all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we help us to find, work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
And also, I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
They might be a <unk> or people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please forgive me in this and not just improve health, but to take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, it's photographs that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph, was woke up with my first digital camera to the 15 years.
He mixed up with my previous passion but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends up when the <unk>
For me photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: A construction is very <unk>
But it has a twist on the world.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or you have pictures like <unk> dark and colorful goal to the common aim of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say configuration, I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want you to have been captured in some way as a photograph.
I think that you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real.
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go into the brain because the brain doesn't really accept the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really going to combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seem realistic -- I think they're those in which we don't even ignore the things that are around us in our everyday life.
But when we combine photographs it's very important, because it otherwise looks wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures of <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect play.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely comprised of photographs of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place that seems to find it -- because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made the house the top of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic result I think it takes planning.
It always starts with an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
This is a diagram anyone who took out of a folder, mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details of the details but the general thing.
It's about an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like many other people that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something weird.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
<unk> more intensity because you write about paper.
Why would we call technology <unk>
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve where you say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any of the technology that I'd like to do -- the diagram would look like something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you say, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very <unk> we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport is going to be as fast as <unk> happened tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There's no precedent in the history of technological development that every few years adds up orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these curves -- we see that they're not still forever.
You can't sustain this change as fast as it goes.
So we would have one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve. I know like this until something totally different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask me, is: what is that new way you take the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition looks very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember as a child was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, across my life.
But I think it's because we feel something going on.
That happens a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
And so I want to talk to you about how that might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer skills.
Because I think the only way to understand it is take distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about 2.5 billion years old when the Earth was a large <unk> of a lot of chemicals that are going on around it.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized we give us a sense of how things came from.
And I think there is theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that moment, it had been floating about <unk> oil with all sorts of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials on the outside and then the drops grew up growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the more <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemists.
And every time they were <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that <unk>
So each <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the blobs that somehow became better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more <unk> <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Most of you lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life chemistry, very simple, but things become interesting when these blobs have learned the trick of abstraction.
And somehow we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this sort of sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same visual system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we used to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants a 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years old.
But then there was another big step happening in which things become very different -- and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, it evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way they avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of <unk> at penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and there was a <unk>
From that <unk> or <unk> place, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community, they were getting more and were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up with so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe from the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a community <unk>
We have a lot of cells that don't just act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the muscles of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that did not do more than process information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these mobile mobile communities.
In fact, they began to <unk> within the community being the <unk> structures and understanding and transmit the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So one organism can, for example, learn not to eat some fruit because I knew bad and sick last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism since before they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by death of individuals who ate that fruit with that fruit were.
So the fact that the nervous system build those information structures that accelerated that evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea in your head.
I'm sitting here sitting in emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar and vague idea, and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we took a very complicated thing to make it in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
We now spend for periods of similar to organisms -- we need our control methods -- presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the <unk> the video, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to drive that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in farmers.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> in which there was a certain evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated over time scales.
The first stages of history that told you took a billion years each.
The next few days, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
Over and so on, they took less than a million years.
And again, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates your own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without recent science advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that does something that was previously done before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes using methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
And we put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the schools?
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions from <unk>
You could run these random instructions at random running all those programs, and taking those things that are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to be able to order a simple example to get a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more coming to tidying up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them made it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now it <unk> the best to <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that children will take the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of the product combinations of the combinations of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat <unk>
<unk> again.
They were able to make some mutations ...
And it tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that orders <unk>
In fact, they're much more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to combine them to see how they work.
It's dark programs.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, I have the safety of the safety of getting the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are going to depend on it.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do a different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering produce.
However, we don't understand all the choices there are.
In that sense, it's going in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is going to go faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to <unk> organisms, when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is.
But now comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to go out <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of it.
It's called average de <unk>
And we talked about 300, a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of the game without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to do it at the first base, not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk> <unk>
You know how a <unk> call a <unk> <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody than 10 <unk>
<unk> like <unk> Ted Williams, the last player of the Mayor Mayor of <unk> in running more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are occupying a surgeon who has also a record for 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear to be wanted to have two clogged arteries -- <unk> and your family doctor gives it to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a lot better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask:
What do you think you must be the average of hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
All right.
And the truth of the issue is nobody in all of the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending me to the world, and I included myself with the <unk> of being perfect.
You never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk> student.
One time, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was studying a whole blood test.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the University of nurses at the General Children's Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> the frequent <unk> and the standard.
And I even knew the <unk> of how they classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> school school with the impression that if you were to <unk> everything, then would you know everything, or as possible, close to the whole, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lunch lady in the emergency service where I was working.
At the time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when emergency room requested to a cardiologist I was going to see that patient.
And to tell the chief of the residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a sound <unk> in both sides, which <unk> me heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes into the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's a hard thing to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> pills of water, so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
Actually, I made two more errors.
I sent her home to her house without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I didn't have what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, I would have been able to give you a <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would make constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And he sent her home, I didn't hear a voice in my inside that he was like, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so unable to ask the nurse that he would join the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the high, and the ambulance next with the ambulance and the ambulance next to her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in your stomach.
But I followed my work.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and truck to the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. At that moment I did something that I don't do normally, I didn't do something that I don't do for.
I went through the emergency service service at home.
And there is another nurse, not the one that <unk> from the lunch lady before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: you remember you?
He remembers the patient he sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
They said, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I came back and the edge of death.
At the end of an hour I had come to her home, after I gave him the high, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance and the ambulance <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> blood pressure -- which means a shock to <unk>
I just breathe and she was blue.
The emergency staff will lay all its resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and hoped against all the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obvious that they never <unk>
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be <unk> to what was happening.
And by ninth day, they let me go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time the <unk> shame in our medical culture, and I sat itself, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the thing that tells us that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I spoke to the family and I'm sure I would take the things and made sure I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> why did I made an error so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day <unk> it opened up the sky and finally came the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect to make any more errors, would make those voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it turned out.
Two years later, I was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man in 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he started here.
I looked at her because I was a little <unk>
He sent him penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> and my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
And he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially mortal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it's the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, he didn't die.
You know, <unk> antibiotics by <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same kind of shame and <unk> and then <unk> and I went back to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to have 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't go home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation of them.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking the patient back into a certain point in the lower right-hand corner, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid command to <unk> and I asked my colleague who was <unk>
I checked it up, and when some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
They were both operated and recovered as well.
But every case I get to me -- I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most significant people have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how I can share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talk about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me that I would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It is the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that <unk> those who can't sleep, and I know that I know that they have <unk> outcomes and those who have a great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you give up medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a bad story of bad medical high-quality medical errors to learn how possible, from the first paper I wrote to the first article that I wrote to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are going to be wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where respiratory infection <unk> are increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, it's dying 24 Canadian <unk> by medical errors.
The U.S. Medical Institute set <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is added up every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to do a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, and he comes up with <unk> eyes, and with breath alcohol and all of a sudden, my story is <unk> by contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we were <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, not going to be any more.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white, <unk> art, it's already a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the ambulance to the head of <unk> <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah -- "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> being able to say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical <unk>
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, they know the human, they accept it, and they are not proud of their errors, but it gets fun to learn from what happened to teach others.
They would have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They will give the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and the support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make errors once in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a doctor <unk>
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
I feel a lot of it, but I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day of <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of election that he says to choose a half American, is about 70 a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research on a week to a group of CEO's in business.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks for these executives and the time that they were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about her elections.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> <unk> and how many of an hour?
How does the way they deal with these decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive for please give a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard. There were more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we were taking water from the <unk>
I loved going to that shop, but I was on one occasion, I asked myself, why never do nothing?
This is the <unk> tank.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> well this strategy to offer all of these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists which came every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different types.
<unk> a post to <unk> right at the entrance to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, where people were willing to stop stopping the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> 60 that when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there were only three percent of us got to buy <unk>
If I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy it, <unk> probably <unk> <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices are affecting us in the <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, in between a million Americans, in the country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of money companies available in savings plans.
And we found that there was actually a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of <unk> funds were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that have two funds, the death rate was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 <unk> the death rate went to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there is unintended consequences.
So for the ones who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people are being eaten by avoiding the actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we were arguing to optimize future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to bring more and more possibilities.
What is more likely to do is make the decision that the decision -- even when this is against the self-interest of interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
Are you more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively seen will be better.
The main reason is that we're going to be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have, in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard about before, but it's never been more than today, less than today, than less is more.
People always bothers when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of the strange <unk> options, there will be a <unk> increase in the cost -- there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> happened to 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> I eliminated the products for junk cats that less <unk> has increased the <unk> in <unk> by two major sales and lower costs.
You know the supermarket supermarket has 45 products.
In a grocery store, they provide about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and offers only <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on them.
In the world of the financial supply, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage the choices is the science of David <unk> the Harvard program.
All employees at Harvard are <unk> automatically to a safe quality of life.
Who really wants to choose, they have 20 money -- not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do their <unk>
This session before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a couple of vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give your hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first round, that in the second -- but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the options.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences have to be very <unk> very concrete
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more positive to them.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So at that meeting, I was looking at exactly as a <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that I would tell the personal things that you would think about the positive things that were going to do in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in the Los Angeles <unk> along the corridor <unk> the magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think that the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This scheme of rating is totally useless.
So the categories must indicate something that they were going to do is not that they were <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
What are they supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than what we think about, if we just put it a little bit.
We need to increase economic complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision to make a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, to build a car.
And these choices vary in the number of choices that offers each other.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is change the order that the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, just about four and four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> at 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what about <unk>
How involved you are.
If you get <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates you are <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who are going from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was disrupt the order of the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice could do not say anything about the preferences of <unk> inside, in all ways you get to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> to make alternatives -- <unk> alternatives -- <unk> -- we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented with them were designed to help drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own, or for people to help them.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years of <unk> in East Germany, <unk> if you had a piece of writing to be able to write the government.
I had to register a text of example written with the machine.
And this is so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they were writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of someone who could do this, how much that this would lead to freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a little printed dots on each page that you follow a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three major causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can put up the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to win a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are really a lot of <unk> in line, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal media by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we bought in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy the computer <unk>
The U.S. secret service ago, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> you know his <unk>
And I say today it's more likely than any of us to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going from wrong with worse.
In the future, most of the <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, they motivate the opinions, they motivate laughter.
<unk> like Anonymous are <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a big role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who are doing to protest and the last group is the national states that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the break last fall because of a <unk>
They put the safety of the site and delivered a <unk>
Last week I asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do they serve them?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> the headquarters of the <unk> secret police, in April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale to the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros the government <unk>
The headquarters for the company is right here.
That is, Western governments provide the tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected of a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
<unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we have to do today, will be forever.
<unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have in <unk>
These are the questions that are really concerned about the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Cape National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the largest part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the one that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying are warriors that protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is why there are so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A kid in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions would be afraid.
But I realized that this really doesn't surprise me, because even helping lions see the pen in a long way.
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick the lions to believe that they were near the <unk>
But lions are very smart --  they came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were told, but the second day, they went back and said, this thing is not moving here.  So I jumped and they killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, the lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch switch that turned on and shut off the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a broken <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar panel load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give out outside, because that's where lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, and she asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see it, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of a lot.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to freak out other predators like decentralized <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants in the farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the grasslands, of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric inventions here.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do one near electric <unk> One near <unk>
<unk> I know that there was already the electric speed, but I want to do mine.
CA: So I heard it -- once, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: The <unk> <unk> <unk> you're something big.
We're going to go to <unk> every single step of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called no <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
And sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution for me.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we did this, the five family members will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
As long as I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine led to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived <unk> insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent energy cuts all around me was completely dark in the night except for the lights in the sea in China, and just across the river from my house.
I always asked why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture from North Korea in the night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves from North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river, as well.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life is like a refugee refugee
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also dangerous, because North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a terrible destination back in North Korea.
I was a day, my worst nightmare was done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I was <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to blow up.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer told each other, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking at asylum.
But many of them can be arrested for Chinese and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to be <unk> many other North America have not been so much lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can be done in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to take them to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South
We're all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call a pride with a pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money that sent my family, and as blame my family was going to be displaced to the force to a place of a place from the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
And so I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to take it in some way, for over three thousand miles through China and then through South Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost trapped several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
And he asked asking them to ask ask them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border.
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest ones in my life.
I did all by release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to a distance from the South Korea.
I was going to come up between the immigration office and the desperately police station, trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English, and with a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I took him with all my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown stranger will make a new hope for me and for the village to be able to do it more than <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the American people need it.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I met in South Korea.
But to get their freedom to be only half the battle.
A lot of North America are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English language, and so on.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family contact, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive an international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North America -- all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food, <unk> ground.
So the planners of the city came together and thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed the <unk> and South Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South <unk>  <unk> of <unk> food, <unk> terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert. The Los Angeles Center for food places to get and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to get more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than, say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this is happening.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of the house you see the effects of the present effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs in wheels and sold as a car <unk>
I see centers of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back to buy an apple that doesn't have <unk>
What I did, it was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of Earth we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet -- three feet.
The point is, in the city.
But you have to keep it over.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it out.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine green vegetables, you know.
What we do, we are a kind of paid group ahead of a <unk> of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone got <unk>
The city stood up with me and I was given a little bit of <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said to me, "Come on, right?
An order for plant food on a piece of land that nobody else is <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. was written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
<unk> is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why the hell does it not look like this?
They put a plant to a thousand, 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
They take your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Southern <unk>
And I grew up there. It will <unk> my children there.
I was pleased to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I'm growing my art.
Such a <unk> artist <unk> walls, <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became a education tool, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You can see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
They get <unk>
I remember one time that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> in the night and they were in my garden, and they were looking very <unk>
Me, man, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> no temes that people are going to steal your <unk>
So I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid that you're going to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how it was affected and how they used to plant them with their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people coming from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they will eat <unk>  But if none of these are being taught if they are not taught how food affects your mind and your body, eat blind and they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're going, I see children of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't lead them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all a block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to carry around and turn them in <unk> healthy.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free, it's not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to work to people, pull out the kids on the street, and they know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
The <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't want to be called if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some of them <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very special road at all.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that you can do.
And especially if you are <unk> in your bike, and these cars go down, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet <unk>
The solution for that is to do roads of asphalt asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is going to be a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and the water can go through it, so that all the rainwater flow around, and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and you will have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hot, all the <unk> noise -- so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You can see that on this highway the stones from the surface is over.
First stone first and more and more, etc., and <unk> well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of <unk> to light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will become <unk> and they will be <unk>
So, if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials in <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use <unk> of steel, of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat steel and melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are going back to the surface.
I used a <unk> oven, because I can't bring the great machine to <unk> here to the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples out there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting.
So we donated a bit of road -- 400 feet from the <unk> highway, where we had to do a <unk> lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the candle test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We were able to age the samples, we put a lot of burden into them, the connections then with our <unk> machine, and we put them back and we put them back into it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using fibers of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, even it can double the surface of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how repairability works.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's watch. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News in his little gray radius.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those time because the news is generally <unk>
She said, "The Taliban <unk> her father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and they were illegal to make girls in school.
For the next five years, I was fascinated by as a child to <unk> my older sister that I could no longer be alone to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that two could be <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we had our own lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, school was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but yet the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, out to the school and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to convert our home home to girls and women of our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate his children.
For the years of <unk> I remember there were moments where I was very frustrated for our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter, me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can get them to leave your house during a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So, you still want it to be <unk>
I am 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud of graduate school in <unk>
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home to the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my university degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why I <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like my friends, <unk> for them, despite the face of a <unk> opposition
As <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went from the road from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped to be killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if he kept sending your daughter to school, they would come back again.
<unk> right now, if <unk> said, "but not going to hurt the future of my daughter by her old and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it is something that is often often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, it's often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like east of Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> girls who were to the school they tell in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks as different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
They would argue that these changes wouldn't last last long after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were going to do <unk> -- I see a future <unk> and a <unk> shift.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution was inspired by the wave of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, are carrying away from freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown a little bit drawn to the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a loss of about 50,000 people, we can release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved alongside many other women, to rebuild civil society -- <unk> civil society -- <unk> a inclusive transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm began to organize workshops about the development of capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we started the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our law of engaging in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> that was <unk> from political policies and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, soon enough, the joy of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day we had the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the heart attack.
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of army officers from the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made by a revolutionary mindset, and it has been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, social justice, and we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
I'm here today to tell us that we are, as a nation, and we are choosing the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't bring peace and stability and safety to Libya.
<unk> list and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like <unk>
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election that we needed the choices -- that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs a <unk> representation of the most of the more that the performance is going to need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use it.
We need to stop acting as police agents and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which is not only <unk> but also putting the mercy of <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by the war, desperately needs to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> that comes from the interrelationship and the <unk> between the female perspectives and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which spans the humanity of the men and women, that all tribes and women, that all tribes have been <unk>
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all the existence.
So this is how it tells us, "My mercy is <unk>
This is how it tells us "My <unk> mercy on my <unk>
What they are all about the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a happy question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence and the question that I'm going to deal with is the one that they all do. Why is she left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no learning in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City by my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first American <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I was creating my soul <unk> I would join the head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved one who loved anyone in this world, he put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trick, of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent the most part of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between those Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been married about 20 years old with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of all, all the religions, all of the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> and long duration or, in the families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse, it turns out so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to stay with a man who has it, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls were killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold <unk> <unk>
I was sitting next to the New York subway in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he had just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and that I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
He had a few big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started out there, and he loved all of me, who was ready, that he had gone to Harvard, who would put a passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know that all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York to leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I quit my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a physical trap financial and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it react to.
And here is where they come into the scene those <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where you're supposed to do, I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept her under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to cause the trauma that they lived from smaller.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never raised my hand, my life was already seriously serious -- every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit on my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we lived happy forever, because I loved her, and he also wanted a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
There were just very <unk> by the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I had never hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he got me so strong in the head that I had a lot of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey -- he went through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> continued to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Disease Control Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why would I <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that he could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is, why does it just not be <unk>
Why wouldn't it be <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because us, our victims, we know something that you normally have, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has gone to the end to the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and engineering system in family system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time -- not <unk> with the man who were sending their mother.
And we still keep wondering why it doesn't just go?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> it will beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed if he was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told it to all the world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, all to come to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
And for some people is a way to say, <unk> is a <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also assume that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and to transcend their lives joyful and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of a very typical domestic violence.
I became marrying a nice man and <unk> and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to have never ever ever got is a <unk> pistol to my head in someone who says I want.
At this moment, the same is thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about is you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were from small or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting your daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to finally put my crazy love to my particular love of silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives on silence.
They have the power to finish domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
We need the victims we need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> to the light talking about it with their children, their colleagues and family and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people, and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down your climb and show the victims a safe way to be <unk>
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call it Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm model.
To be accurate for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a very uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have dressed like this.  luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are getting rid of when they <unk> they don't have to get them right now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
So these troubles are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to happen this sweater, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but they also <unk>
I have changed what they thought of myself in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
And he was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would <unk> the back and that <unk> the hair of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we could do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a big impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model of a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman and in my workforce, that's a sexy.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what's this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined the beauty as youth and youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> also that we have associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to leverage to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold on, they are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we need them to know so many models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> is to say, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know.
But then what I would really tell you about one of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be <unk> from the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> <unk> which would be awesome, as you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, it's still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> head of American journal or the CEO of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike surgical surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have a pair of studies, and you have a letter and get some jobs out of your backs, no matter what you want, is to say, if you want to be President of the United States, but you have to be <unk> <unk> of clothing for 10 years, people would look really weird.
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I told me, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This is how I wore my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here's a <unk> party a few days before the pictures for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team, and in Wired magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not in those pictures.
They are <unk> <unk> <unk> and photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and people and <unk> and <unk> and get this to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a grocery store, and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> a red <unk> and of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to be able to <unk>
<unk> of these privileges for my look, not what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for your side, no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and Latino and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's about how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I learned that by 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most bright hair, you will feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe that <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair, it will be happier.
They only have to come together with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> little hair and the <unk> hair and the <unk> and it's probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that will hold out of this talk, I hope you are all more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was good enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- and I didn't have me who <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk> no <unk> no chance to repeat the photos, not even a little bit of <unk>
In fact, most of them were taking out at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and the 5.
He happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that they were going to get to us with a picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, never nobody has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter, what had happened that day that a five-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in a October week and we think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always took the same photo, our perspective changes, my daughter takes new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how it interacts with everything.
That particular time in concrete we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, at one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly he stood up in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the glass store, which <unk> in the previous <unk>
And he described me what I had to do to five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that reminded their heart of heart with the strength of the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 photos, I don't know in many of the family pictures.
I am always the picture.
Today I want to encourage you to come up in the picture, and you didn't get to <unk> in reaching up to someone and asked, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney <unk> <unk> as stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, laughter, and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> But I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. Do you know why?
Because members of Parliament are not clean the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And they're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World -- which are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why do the <unk> are important, first of all, they provide vital green services <unk>
They are our natural garbage <unk>
They get the carcasses up to the bone.
They help all of the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that not because they would stretch and cause great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous historic importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and the maternity symbol -- and along with the <unk> <unk> the unity between the <unk> and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> in places like Tibet, in Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a system of natural <unk>
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities, use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are at the critically endangered list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey at the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned by using vet in India and have taken a statement.
Because there is no <unk> there's been a spread on the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb -- the number of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They are <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible <unk> trade in the way to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? OK, we are doing these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so I will focus on an underground problem is not going to be at all.
We need to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can aid aid? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you will tell them about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do is I do <unk> my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a nonprofit NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
They were going to take the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all you would call it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with seeds in the south of Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that goes down to the river <unk> and teach people to grow tomatoes and grow tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they don't <unk>   We were a lot of people that local in so fertile -- they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't do anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> to the people of Zambia of the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a bird would grow this size. In Zambia.
And we couldn't believe that, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red in night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought only about Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, were doing the English and what the surgeon did, and then to see what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's see the <unk> --  <unk> to see the waste that would give you to the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> of an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids, you want a lot."
<unk> I treat all of the different culture as if they were my <unk>
That's why white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can just imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to just answer the people, I just respond to people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you would never belong to anybody, but it becomes a <unk> of local <unk> the local <unk> the local dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do?
You can never get a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We put together a coffee. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful in the world.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not -- for one time, they were <unk> but not in <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what have they <unk>
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't even adopt their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor, the family doctor, in the business of the business of the business of the business table in your kitchen table at the table, and that helps you find the resources to transform his passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city from Western Australia City.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this condescending junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so the government says, <unk>  So the government says, <unk> again.  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business personnel in history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they become involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
The planning is the kiss of the death of the spirit of business.
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their energy itself.
You have to learn to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you for <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they will come in in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to take away with you more this tomorrow?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I'm telling you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we are in the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> <unk> and one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we need to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that was in a futuristic journal many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> met this group of people. And <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing to this <unk> to move the population from New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses. and the manure has been produced by six million horses.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we had <unk> New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came up with <unk> corporate manufacturers companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology that was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in places that are <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they don't come to talk with you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> dedicated service.
And then you get to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a great financial <unk>
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, selling and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This was still not born.
We've looked at the research and looked at the 100 hundred companies icons on the world -- <unk> <unk> Ford -- all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, just one, only one was started by one person.
I never heard the word, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
And so we can create the community where we have <unk> who are coming from a small business environment in <unk> and in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who asked you, what should you need?
What can you do? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." And you know, I would find <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The ones around us can help us many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't spend a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs of our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that gives shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries of a city.
It doesn't always happen to music --  -- there's a couple of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one with the most beautiful <unk> of the U.S.
I live close to this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
He was sudden and he was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death and I think.
And it produced me a profound gratitude for the time and lived and so on.
It gave it clarity to the significant things about my life today.
But I was able to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch the day to day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this left house on a giant board and he painted it on her sentences for <unk> Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and he was still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before she died, I want to be shot by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of change from <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I die I want to hear you once more."
Before I die I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes for people to get me laugh at <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection and <unk> and of remembering what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit, and now they've been made walls in countries around the world, as <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is very short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking about, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we will give us more power.
It's going to think about the death of our life.
Our shared spaces can actually reflect the best thing that matters as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help but help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my brothers.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very <unk>
Don't speak, but it transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> shares what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
I don't care about religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I even might not even know -- it reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but I remember the year that I came out every year of my iPod, <unk> conversations that we ran when I was four years old, I was getting pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although I didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary people.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every single individual, it manifests themselves in a different way, where it <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes will be diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause any <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self to be in my life.
When I was a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I was pleasure in the smallest things like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the machine and eating anything that would have <unk>
As I grew up growing more different, and the differences were getting more evident.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some moments in my family, moments that I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that they have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change by normal.
Nature goes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you know, you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift on your inner and, frankly, the search for normal, is the ultimate <unk> <unk>
The opportunity for <unk> progress and the change dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it should have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher who gave a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big books and their big <unk> words.
But when they develop those conversations, I felt what they had, must have felt that when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door in a new world.
So I just sat down when I had these conversations with the students. They surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and health care environment, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we didn't have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and his engineering is attractive.
First question to <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that we study the <unk> but we study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when they're describing their science, careful with <unk>
The slang is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing that make them dumb things.
Rather, as Einstein, as Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They are ways of <unk> and <unk> with its content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been wondering why they call <unk>  What do they do <unk> bullets are killed and <unk> your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supporting too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that actually inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we provide graphics that supports our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it will be.
I think these are just a few keys that can help the others open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English English is <unk>
It's simply because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that he defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one that looks for a public charge or no matter what you have to do is -- and that, when you won, you get it for the mere use of monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
Something that I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the unusual name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk> <unk>
Most people think it's literal <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
They didn't know that.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the American People -- the United States.
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call him <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
Everyone got tired of <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the diary of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King by whether he did it or his <unk> ideas.
So they wanted to give her the most <unk> more <unk> and more <unk> which came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was just before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were Indian presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> degree.
And that's why the Senate was <unk>
They said, "Is it ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to take a <unk> degree with a <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate wouldn't be <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> by the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we can keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to do is that the president of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 warheads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of aerial <unk> and so on.
The reality and history has fed the title of <unk>
So eventually I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness for then.
But you know how many nations have <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Now, politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really change the words much more than the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to a <unk> in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, especially that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones with primitive.
As the rest of the day, I carry a cheap light of light on the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
And my hand is <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a mining when I met a mining days earlier, that he lost the control and he dropped 5,000 feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the depths of that hole and risking their lives without paying reward and often dying.
And I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and in 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been involved to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not to such grade.
When we finished talking to me -- I was very sad, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me up and got up a stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
This is how my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of the people were considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of displaced Africans during the entire age of slave slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of a few thousand of us today.
And yet, today you can inspire entire families for generations to <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled by false promises of good education and better work for then to find out that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates on the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and <unk> was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> <unk> mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically ventilated <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no toilet enough to eat, and to drink, and the severe <unk> made it that I would pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment for these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to tears, but the <unk> who was next to me quickly grabbed me and said, "You know, <unk> don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to demonstrate to emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for its liberation and he trusted you to do it.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
And in the Himalayas, he found kids covering stones for miles out of <unk> to trucks who were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids that were lifted and children would take them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> they had <unk>
When we hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global awareness they warned me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
He took me through some stairs <unk> that gave this dirty <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for forced prostitution, <unk>
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> <unk> fear and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be caught in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I was born.
No <unk>
There were no open windows to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and since you touch a subject so hard, it's important to point out that slavery is even the sex aid, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a slave for sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were whole families who had been involved in the silk trade.
This is a family.
The black hands is the father, the blue <unk> and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk on the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, being able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where you actually pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look.
I saw what it seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two older brothers -- some younger children, some younger children makes sense right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families and forced them to work <unk> on these boats in the lake in the lake, even though they don't know swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with it was <unk> I think his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, and with fear, they get to the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
By fear of his love, it's not going to run away and, as life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it is to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they <unk> the latest networks, but they had been working from a single day.
<unk> and <unk>
And it can point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who gets to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their <unk> suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to do it by a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to get out of the car, and asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just and he said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the road and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of photos over my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of of course, and we had a bunch of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children in their backs and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember I looked at his tired, tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to be 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area in which the stone would be able to extract the gold.
First of the view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the edge of the side, the margin is going to be working on the least lucky time, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When he died, her father took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> I inherit it was the debt of the uncle who force it to be slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the 14 years and the injury of the leg you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and yet to that, is forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he wants to be liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, from face to a remote, which inspires me a lot respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testament to them and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very hard to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day to happen to me that I don't think in these many beautiful people, <unk> I've had the great honor to meet.
And I hope that these images wake up a force in those who can see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematics math and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the management management.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were pleased with the <unk> and the <unk> dancers and that we'll see later on.
But compassion, demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some initial <unk> that can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- gradually this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a robust, a ballet ballet memory.
Over the last few years, it's gotten a lot about the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we can know if we really have a cure to be when we have an objective measure and an objective measure of it.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological <unk> so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of clinical trials, it's never been done. It's never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a journey to the clinic -- what if patients could get the test ourselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is <unk> as a kind of conventional way to try, you see, in a certain sense at least we are all <unk> as my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds when we speak. We can imagine, as dancers of a vocal <unk> because we need to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the necessary genes on it.
And as they did it, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as well as the Parkinson's and the Parkinson's is affecting the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the plot plot you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the mental difficulties of patients.
It would not need to go to the clinic for the routine.
We could often get goals.
We could do a massive low-cost for clinical trials for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I will give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> Initiative.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call low price and make recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, you can say, who is healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You can see, some people can not afford it; you might not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the world's factors for the actual markers of disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy at this point?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has been shown that it works on the mobile phone network, as well, what the answer is, now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the dark, in <unk> rooms and generally we avoid sunlight.
We make the standard models still more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect, we make the impossible, and we were going to get rid of the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste for the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
A few time later, an organization where he was <unk> there, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the feedback team.
I, with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 <unk>
It's a small village of fishermen located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave, one of the first villages affected by it.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from the channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> <unk> and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around us to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they went from the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a city center of the town.
It helped clean up the <unk> toilets, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor and I had the honor that it was <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going through myself my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the photos, I found some of them who had over a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and I can repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I was supposed to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, they got a little bit more pictures, and they took more <unk> so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people were offered to help.
At the end of two weeks, I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a town neighbor north of <unk>
Once we use a week we use our scanner in the temporal operating libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, <unk> of course of the photos.
It could take an hour. It could be a few weeks old.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much to hand using as a guide the areas that color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in the water -- covered in bacteria, with algae -- even oil, all of that with the time of the time I continue to <unk> this was a very important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the picture unless I was clean clean and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos of <unk>
As he said once, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but stopped the realization that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have <unk> we were able to take the images in a single photo, and they would take the whole picture.
When I collected their pictures shared something about her story with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble of the rubble that he used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their young kids, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photos his youngest son was at age 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could come back to look, something that I could remember from the past one day -- when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined out there -- hundreds of them helped us clean to hand over <unk> photos -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families hundreds of photos fully <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 in teams and materials, most ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, a new person.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would take for us, but the first thing that we want to look for.
This is about the project, to restore little bits of humanity, to return to someone with the past.
When a picture like this, you give someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that you get.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something larger with something bigger -- to bring up something, using your talent to something that they are not possible models of perfect skin.
So I would just like to read this email. He sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't help you think about people and stories shown in the images.
One particular one, a picture of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, gathering around a baby, and I was amazed because a similar picture of my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my mother, <unk> <unk>
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs -- right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in a millionth of just a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
So I give you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique so fast that can create videos in slow motion on motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see after <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, <unk> and defy the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch on and put it into a <unk> of a second or a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just a millimeter of wide square.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this array of photons and <unk> it in this bottle, how do you care about those photons within this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in a <unk> camera.
Now, all of this --  --  -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle with a photons package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Most of the photons eventually come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble <unk>
At that time, the waves travel down the table, and because of the <unk> of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if you take a bullet bullet and we make it go down the same distance and we see it in slow motion about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to sit down to see that movie?
A day? A week? Actually, a single year.
It would be a very boring film, a slow bullet into movement.
And what about trying to do with nature <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a photo, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of composition here.
But if you look more and more and more of this -- you'll notice that, as the light goes out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the lighting light inside its inside and it comes back after several <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT?
Like photographers, you know, if you take a photo to a <unk> <unk> it goes very little light in.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest one, so I just get into something of light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create these <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door -- you will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera, and from there to the camera.
We could extract those multiple <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there's a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our paper in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will come back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects -- but we don't know what dot corresponds to what a distance.
So by projecting a laser can record a <unk> picture that you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we will be able to see the object <unk>
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what's going back on the curve, and the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows by open open.
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see the inside of the body by <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood of this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists so that start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, I became science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the data <unk> that we collect every time is not just for scientific visualization, but we can be able to be able to see scientific visualization, but we can be able to see a scientific visualization, but we can be able to see a scientific visualization, but we can be able to see a scientific visualization, but we can be able to see a scientific
And create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and code of colored <unk>
Let's look at those waves -- remember, the time between one of those waves is only about a few <unk> of a second.
But here is also some fun thing.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. And Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events happen in the world sometimes appears on the camera.
<unk> the corresponding need of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can transform life, and you give freedom <unk>
With a mobile phone, it can <unk> a crime against the humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and it will be a famous <unk>
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and living in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who is a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your phones, <unk>
<unk> A Android, your Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of us today with a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission filed a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every Internet Internet provider have to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phone and the Internet providers.
There were lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East <unk>
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Whenever we use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> who was in that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for please me, all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask it, and I didn't get a concrete response, it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit that I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end of the end, they <unk>
They would take the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law for the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD in it.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand pounds of information.
At the beginning, I saw them and said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step up at night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in, and you won't go back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other, what time they do is they call each other, what time you go to sleep.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people on the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, either.
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information of us as possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to get them forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and that's not quite a fashion.
When you go home, you get your representative representative to your representative representative for companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your telephone company, what information store you are.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result of a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why they would bring all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus -- and not the <unk> because my parents were brothers, but they are.
Just by accidents, as the one that happened at birth.
Now, I am <unk> I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of any of us in there.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, you've wanted to be a disabled.
<unk>
Christmas Day -- they're in the shopping mall, drive in circles to search for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 empty places for a disabled.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you probably should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial lesson.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was: "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters went to the public school, my parents would go to the school system and get rid of it that I was also going, and if we didn't take out all of the top note -- every single note -- the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk back to the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to get it to it.
The <unk> that I carry inside it was very strong and <unk>
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a baseball champion who has received many <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> as a slogan <unk>
The people that I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of people from hunger during the <unk>
I would tell you that he had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> from dawn to sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay physical therapy -- so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to pass the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents worried that if I won't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
On the summer vacation often my father tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk on my back, and I was putting hot cups on the back, I was <unk> in the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in my head.
My parents will come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> in the theater.
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, took the top note in my class, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass Zoo.
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> <unk>
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> <unk> I will end up having a <unk>
I've learned <unk>
In order to <unk> In order to <unk>
Thank God <unk> in the end I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying in historically, historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because she thought I could not do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that literally had been born and gave a actress without cerebral <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> <unk> actors for disabled papers.
I went back home, and my first <unk> <unk> was an extra thing in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there like a <unk> I didn't see myself more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of <unk> not <unk> actors, not white, <unk>
They only get to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took the famous New York City in New York City to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first note that he took when he landed on the realization that I was at high-speed the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without any veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find really fun.
In 2003, my brother with another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of the <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in the media, and at the time I remind the <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the <unk> news program, with Keith <unk>
I went in as if I was a graduate school dance to me to a study and sat in a <unk>
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I hold on the desk in the speaker to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like participant in the full time and hit my chair.
A fun thing I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that children are <unk> but they never <unk> from me not to be a young girl nor old.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
They would take clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It is <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What is it?
We really should pray for it.
A guy suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are <unk> Yeah, man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
Doctors said not to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images that would have more positive on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world -- Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in this great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> children of <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugees, Palestinians refugees -- a very much part of what my parents would <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me work alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a little village to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without it, he goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, no work, or any future <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day I read about a gentleman who offers him to <unk> after dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
He gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, her family.
I presented to a young lady.
Finally home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky. <unk> a bomb.
That child from that little town with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> <unk> and that dynamic group of people were to the <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a young child trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came up.
This was the first thing that took him from what we call the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity work, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them <unk> opportunities, the story of the <unk> the door of access to terror, to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> will be the history of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent doesn't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember being at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had been forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support young leaders at a business peak.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges that the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, that because he was a graduate graduate college college was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to come from point to the point B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> he saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> <unk> local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and her dream is at some point to grow hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
They encouraged young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years ago, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from the overseas.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a <unk> company.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said he would survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the world's first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So inspire young people to create a business of business spirit -- it's really a big step, but the young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation for <unk> in development and setting out of their businesses.
They give young people with the resources that they need, they need the support they need to move from conception to creation and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park Park is how it called, when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the bikes for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks Parks that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> mountains, <unk> area in the northern New York state.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was made that the leaves sheets like a <unk> and not the way that we could <unk> almost we could pretend that we were the first human beings on the ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight to a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts with apple <unk> balls and <unk> balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy as to pull what they had <unk> who thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and he got a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where <unk> <unk> who clean our trash <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department of <unk> clean our trash, <unk> of waste and two tons of waste products -- every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his trajectories and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more.
So I began to work like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> and bar the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
There is there, but it's not as glamorous as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very hard for you to get it up.
It costs a lot of used in weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies were still pushing up to the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection collection is one of the 10 most dangerous ones in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving in traffic all day and <unk> <unk> around you.
They just want to be <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is filled with dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's also like a breathing or circulation.
It always needs to be moving.
And it's the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> of waste is the most important hand hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and effective and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> from their containers and their dangers inherent would threaten us in very real forms.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries coming back to come, and they start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the economy of the economy begin to fail when it's at the danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just put the relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed we need.
So I mean simply at the speed of which we used to move in the contemporary time.
We don't usually have <unk> and we don't get rid of it, we cleaned up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- we forget them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that it was making of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and engage in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection of waste on the street, grabbed my little son, and he went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of paper <unk> as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that, I started to research the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we must include and see all the cost -- even the real human cost of labor labor.
The city waste -- what we think when we talk about garbage is three percent of the amount of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable scenario.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one to see someone whose work is to clean the crap of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life, forming a part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example to my team and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because of the transmission of crystals generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it comes from a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees in the entire year.
And thirdly, what has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really captivated by the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
That's the idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how do we build a building, of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site the site, which is located in a very much growth area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs from the building.
And it extends out with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the building that is driven by its own shape of the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue similar to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air input and also from light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have the properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> parts, which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals of colors that use the light of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas that was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center.
But we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the shopping center because in order to support there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic, not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no need to have the air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting on the ceiling.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis.
And these <unk> on the ceiling, that they collect water for inner <unk>
It's waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we're going through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention on <unk> a year of 1,000 years old that he was surrounded by a wall with 12 access doors connected by almost straight.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was <unk> the existing streets by creating 12 early blocks similar to the size and features that exist in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we <unk> a framework that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local rules that set up higher density in the upper levels and a lower density in the low level.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as soon as I would turn into the community that occupied space.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and <unk> and do such as a <unk> run in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same pace growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had a very bright hair of hair and a little <unk> of cute <unk> <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of Miami until I had my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the <unk> I was a little late and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I went from the table of my teacher to the Japanese book.
And then I did.
I had the ratings in my <unk> just a little bit, just a few things.
All the way --  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put every rows of <unk> and I went to myself a row in front of it, just by being there, since I was there.
I'm still amazed at what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I think, the reason that I was bothered by this little girl as small, it was so good for <unk>
I <unk> jealousy.
They are so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause one of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that we would have been able to do, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab that we study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be not literature.
Well, they wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
There would be <unk>
<unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> there would be no <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without school, there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers to everything, and as soon as the city is almost all of them.
This year is 100 years of his work <unk> "In <unk> time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from the ordinary <unk> -- all we could have.
We think about a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious to be very obvious as the religions that get to the person, to their wish, their <unk> are a good narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we come together, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about the lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
To be <unk> and audience, we know exactly what <unk> <unk> to nail the knife, right?
The <unk> are doing all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understood understood.
Everything that she does to get me pleasure could give them pleasure to another time right now."
And it starts to say itself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- he adds it to his collection of <unk> instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> <unk>
And what are the <unk>
<unk> is <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like a great bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in their <unk> agony as soon listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then they Mo those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an ancient text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they're search of knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful. In fact, what to <unk> -- the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us to a much more profound feelings and more vital feelings that a wise man who could be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women to <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this kind of <unk>
Is there any other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at such a <unk>
Freud write about this later.
One day, Freud had visited by a young young man who was consumed with the idea that his woman was doing it.
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, which was not <unk> in what his wife's did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was <unk> with no cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing it, behavior.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels described very well how the <unk> are doing to look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent and illegal <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself in the age of eight, but I'm also thinking about this story in the history of the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which they were sending up with terrible messages in itself, for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to <unk> the new bride of her former boyfriend. So I have to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge -- even though <unk> creativity.
It's like <unk>
As a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to how the reality of our minds, our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the Canada -- the membrane that it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to <unk> or want what you have to get to the <unk> of your self and to <unk> what ever <unk> and it's under the floor. <unk> your name, takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all around the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> who needs to <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius -- but she's annoyed it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> it needs your help, but they <unk> it and <unk> them in the each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of the solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who don't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> was in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be that easy?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> the terrifying line <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in a great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21, of July Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the module of Apollo 11 and went on the Sea of <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the surface of the surface of the surface is the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest shift in history of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
<unk> people, including <unk> <unk>
But before the Apollo Apollo program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which came up after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the word <unk> at the University of Rice in <unk> gives you a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why is it <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why do you scale the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would they fly about <unk>
Why play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> <unk> <unk> was not just a victory of the west of the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the feelings of the technology of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology's <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and <unk> smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a candle ship, but in 1969, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
From 1970, no human being turned to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> <unk> and the optimism glad about the power of technology has been reluctant to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars, create clean energy, create a clean energy, to cure cancer, or feeding the world's population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he didn't get to the <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew loosely that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would be able to see the colonies on Mars.
So that doesn't happen to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists were <unk> and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation for <unk> in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created less ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years to be <unk> MIT, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are all the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas for the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying for the risk, they preferred investment, investments that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies as energy, which need a massive capital and which development is long-term and development is long-term not in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have a straight commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular -- and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems are fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic and the reason it's completely cheap.
Eighty and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties -- the development of a <unk> energy development, a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we'll see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they are not to be.
We know for a long time that famines are a result of the failure of food.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are policies that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or the systems for storage and <unk> but there will be generated as bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon was declared the war to the cancer in 1971, but we soon found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant people to the treatment, and only over the last 10 years they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population of the population must want to solve the problem: institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it meets those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there's no <unk> science of science fiction like the <unk> of the solar system.
In general, go to the Moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even have any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by <unk> the ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very general belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think <unk> the goal and the task has been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> an objective and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First <unk> why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I can start to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions, and that could be up in others.
I don't have the clear.
But I can turn to reverse polls and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are going to do 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway in the street.
But this is this evidence for enough?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people look at when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You probably ask the question: "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some other not."
What is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to create the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> officer or a kind of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say that I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the reading class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> fashion.
I think polls are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust -- because they try to do the good trial in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what it is to trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I am <unk> of not going to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who were holding their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, it means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw materials -- and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to get a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still don't have <unk>
But that's what we're going to have to do before we have that trust.
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build systems from accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and <unk> and so forth, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I will attend to <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public and public and <unk> that the accountability system is destined to ensure that <unk> and testing test is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
<unk> all of that, by the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we are confident to be worthy of trust, and we will tell people that we are safe and whether to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- the <unk> what doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if you're two people, you know, trying to improve trust.
But the confidence in the end, is defining because we give us a lot of other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give you the foundations enough so that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't push it through all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to make the evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That makes every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple example of commercial example.
The shop where I bought my socks says I can <unk> it without giving explanations for us.
I take them and get me the money, or they change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I'm confident in them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think that what we're going on is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly going to be more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
So I started to imagine how to <unk>
So first I created this tool that gets deeper into digital space, so when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers your physical body versus the pixels.
So designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs, underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the ability of the hands?
In the University of Sciences <unk> of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a computer digital area.
<unk> a transparent shot with chambers deep to detect your fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, and get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> it's so easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and emphasize lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that there's the bottom of the floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
So in these examples, we have <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and returned things through the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just looking at pixels in the space, how we can make it physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like that?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this one physical procedure.
This <unk> magnet behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And in digitally programming the object, we release it out of the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan you can reproduce it as a physical reality of physics that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real experience, palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating about changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not only show us something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to lead to a school to athletes with all expenses costs.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only a immediate way to <unk> a safe job, and well <unk>
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera opera singer here.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
Until I wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio program.
But no adult asked the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream would never be <unk>
I think that during the rest of my life a second class of happiness is only the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to find another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Tell books.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> "I miss the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the U.S. in 1995, and what were the first books that are going on?
They were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and so much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this trap. <unk> guilt trap.
The encounter with a new culture also gave my <unk> <unk>
They put a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map, I found it out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's all the way to research as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working for research, why not do it also in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> of David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic, political and spiritual.
To the Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  Instead of getting lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like that or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
And I have come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Her most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion comes from, where the passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And because of the books, I'm now here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> he jumped on the couch of my office and he grabbed my shoes off and told me I wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex brought up to the <unk> became easy to just move the head while I would take the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and so I saw myself, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, she gets children later, until death goes afterwards.
<unk> as Alex and I had time from <unk>
But a bit later, my <unk> still pushed me to press Alex that I'd talk about his life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe he <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call <unk>
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel the head after what they had, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in their development.
This made of Alex <unk> were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of visitor's Artificial was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets to adulthood.
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah! It's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream -- I want to watch. It's okay. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give you a way to your life have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
People of the '40s, not <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future future for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than any other time of life and we know that female fertility comes to its top to 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical time in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline, <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
<unk> are <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Right?
What do you think about when you give a <unk> on your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing happens.
And then every day every day, <unk> intelligent, interesting people like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't matter.
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are on <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I was better hearing the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of the chairs.
They were all running, but then at some point around the 30, he turned out the music and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair.
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things to the <unk> there's a huge pressure on 30 and so many starting a career, to choose a city, to choose a mate, and have two or three children in a very long period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful enough, to do everything in the <unk>
The middle-aged middle crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
You see, you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about his <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At age 25, Emma got to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living <unk> very difficult, his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often often in our <unk> but then she was getting up and she would say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just bought a new book book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning I had a lot of <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if I give you <unk>
At that moment, I had a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that I really needed <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I was just sitting while the decade of Emma was going to go forward.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told him to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told her to Emma who were getting rid of that crisis of identity and <unk> capital capital.
By identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this -- of identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> the exploration of exploration -- I'm putting the exploration that I shouldn't tell -- which, by the way, isn't exploration, that by the way.
It's <unk>
I told her to Emma who would look at work, and I told them to tell you.
Second, I told her to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds they are limited to who you know, what you know about, how do you think about, how do they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, the new person with whom was almost always coming out of the outside of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak ties to your friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half is not, and the weak bonds are the way we can engage this group.
Half of the jobs created never been <unk> then, knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job of a <unk>
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
On the end, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as he was growing up, Emma would soon join her family when she has a partner and it exists in his own family.
I told him how long time to choose his family had come.
You might think the 30 is better age to sit at the head than 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or tell you, now when everyone on Facebook start to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it will work or kill time with anyone that you will take them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we went through that <unk> and she found the fellow <unk> of a cousin who was working in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That job supply was given a reason to leave the boyfriend, who lives alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not enough.
History may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes who come out of the L.A. Airport who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years, or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to tell <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their <unk> to use identity, use their weak ties.
They won't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding your life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management consulting for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics by seventh degree in public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I do tasks.
When I was working it was going to be fascinated by grades.
What I was called the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance test scores were <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every single one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a psychological perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure the better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn from a rapid and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who is success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids were going to do as far as we could in the competition.
We studied teachers who are working in really difficult neighborhoods, and <unk> what teachers are you going to be teaching for the end of the school year and of <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, asking yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, we came up with a feature as a major <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physics of physics and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live the life as if it was a <unk> not a running race.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that made my questionnaires of determination and then waited about a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of evidence -- even the security results they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National National <unk> where <unk> matters in school, it's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know how little science knows the science of development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How does determination in children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a <unk> ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are just not following their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is commonly related to it or it's even related to the <unk>
Until now, the best idea I've heard about developing determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University, by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when it <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been a successful and we need to be willing to fail, and we need to start to start all of new with the <unk> lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese character.
From that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that whatever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started to learn how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right picture.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy as well.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature, enough to read about traffic <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you could even be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person in both sides, as if I were screaming <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are <unk>
If a person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> that is this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a French, like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of course, because a single tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two dozen together, it's very hot.
Three <unk> -- that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming up hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women are <unk> <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn is a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we start creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains, one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells them to tell you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my favorite films when my daughter was four years old, we saw the <unk> of Oz together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children in a kind of <unk> of child fantasy show.
However, the <unk> of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a boy of metal and a <unk> kid would send a girl in their front of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the <unk> of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the military <unk> of the evil <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Wars <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  So she was so slid in the room and was struck in the room and was struck as a foot left with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what it was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
He should be a feeling that Luke was an army to overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> of Oz
How do I win Dorothy your movie?
In doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to be able to grow out of right? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there as much force capital F, a force in the movies for our children, and so little of the path of bricks <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> it's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for the experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give the proper framework that would have been served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I really hoped that the dollars started to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is done, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney before any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they guys, they are not really their target public.
They do a fantastic work by teaching girls how to defend against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movie.
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to see in classical after classic each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who they bred a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation I'd had with a conversation about the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> -- in the movie, there's more than a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than a <unk>  All right? Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things with each other.
<unk> I've seen, and I rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> movie <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> a consensus idea of what a movie Hollywood movie is.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film is happening in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we were going to be <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular movies, how many people believe they have <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
One in the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually sexually ever in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for kids have something to do with that.
Nor do I think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I listen to that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a great amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What don't they do <unk>
They are <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same world, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools in our willingness to <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> are educating our children to keep their power to be able to get their own power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mostly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of man is changing radically.
You have to read about how the new economy is changing the role of the way we care about home and <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter, what was his favorite favorite character of "Star <unk> Do you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just a brilliant dress ...
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to engage their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories on the ones that tell me to my <unk> Go and stay and even more stories where his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I liked was looking for a lot of sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was fascinated by <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown to one of almost 1,300 miles of length along the <unk>
And my pockets had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to using satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you one example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process using the fake, suddenly the place looks like a brilliant pink place.
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes in the landscape of building materials and the old Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find an old city -- old called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great revival of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge continuous <unk>
This area is huge -- it measures about <unk> per <unk> per mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this one, and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try and find at the random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA database to make a map of the place, very subtle changes.
We were able to see where <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that you see inside the circle here, we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of ice, but instead of climate change, we look at layers of human nature.
Five meters down, under a very thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
So this means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We also found out work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense <unk> of occupation which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a <unk> shop in elite jewelry showing that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find <unk> here, but we would go back to the place in a nearby future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire the Middle Empire was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to mind, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do ideas really happen in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we would have a group of obese <unk> in bicycles.
They are competing in a <unk> race and they go back to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying around everywhere, wheels that goes on on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk> the line.
<unk> in the hall, or what there's the other side of the door, and you look at the quality of light. The light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse which is speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie and you go through it to be on the mouth.
<unk> on one side and join your living room.
In the room, and making maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on the middle of the center, singing <unk> -- I was <unk> <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has coated with a yellow brick path from the oven, and from the oven, come to you -- the <unk> <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that is done every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, waiting, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- they were looking at them just once.
They gave the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
I collect whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he was able to memorize the fastest the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a guy named Ed Cook who had come from England, and he has one of the best memories <unk>
And I said, "Well, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everyone involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to make these miraculous acts of memory using some old old techniques invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and the <unk> academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did you have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English, even though a little <unk> told me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in a national television scanner.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that lets you see how our memory is to us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> and he was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on the written memory about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Latin, in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory and <unk> was not one thing as rare as you might look like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed, and I would say that they have changed the cognitive too.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this competition as unique of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory, to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to have brains in some way, structural or <unk> or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They are smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting difference between the brains of the memory champions and the ones in the control of the control of the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI machine, <unk> their brains as they were throwing up numbers, faces and shapes in the snow. They found that in the memory champions <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed to <unk> a part of the brain that involves space memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something that we can learn from this?
<unk> of competitive <unk> is driving as a armed race in where every year shows someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must have a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In your desk in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half hour. Yeah.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> and absolutely all the techniques by the end, you get down to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It's illustrates with a elegant paradox of known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I tell two people who remember the same word, I'm telling you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you, <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
What do you do?
The person who told us that his name is Baker it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who told the person that his job was <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
With all the other memories you dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They were very good when they come home to work.
You probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this about two and a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired as entertainment, because before before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk> <unk>
He stood up with his memory poem, and he got <unk> and he was so soon he was left -- the classroom was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But it didn't only kill them all, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single way.
I took the family of the hand to the family of the hand where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> pick up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers or <unk> or a word of the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial spacecraft.
If I told you that I gave you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell you who I was sitting on the brown speaker, brown in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember. The things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from memory, the same way that I would have done it, if you had been invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous image crazy image to help you remember the first thing that they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And that would remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you to remind you that anecdote that you want to count.
And then they go through the kitchen, and the room that will talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> don't word for the word, which is going to confuse you, typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in their memory palazzo in your memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got in full of that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking <unk> I mean, that the most exciting thing happens is when someone else is going to be <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or I heard the names of an old school <unk> school in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a quick <unk>
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard training equipment for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of <unk> covered with tape, leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a family competitor of memory.
I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could be able to do it in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers, and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just so only tricks.
Because it's based on the early principles of how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insight, about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
You know, when we focus deeply.
The palace of the <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they do <unk>
So we had a deep processing species of processing, a kind of complete attention that most of them are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today is what the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what's already our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking on our side -- we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even believe in process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so we can only get a place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from the <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my daughter's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time watching the television television -- so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I was <unk> and I would go back wrapped up in a towel -- all I saw myself.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and hated it.
I got that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or of the areas of areas, but of those connections, emotional connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded of architecture.
That's a lot of it.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you guys think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it by based on a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museum museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these stable, stable, stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> who ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, he's got a <unk> he has this round thing, columns red, the red brick -- which you leave <unk> what you know, tries to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of ownership -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of them are called libraries, so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the life forms of life.
We <unk> <unk> and we did so much, we get away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you believe that we feel very good, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and connect to those symbols <unk>
So we do, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we do the middle of the way back to go ahead and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course in the last 30 years.
Well, it was 30 years ago <unk> from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
Let's get the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes are <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
These fantasies could be the <unk> to the French, or to the Italian.
You may have a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we are tracking memories of other places.
I know very well, and you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to get the pendulum coming back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design design techniques by computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are going on against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something would happen.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when general <unk> and public in general, were completely agreement on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this construction of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these different <unk> and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the major mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginnings of the New York City happened with another star.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the recent millennium, it actually started to happen with all of the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
You think, for example, how they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> they can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers photographers and the building is carried beyond the physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't take a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design 2, eight, eight, or 100 more buildings before I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a two years old, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That is never going to happen, because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media, in communication, it starts to swing faster and faster, to be on both extremes almost in <unk> and it will be really <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make <unk> symbols with emotional load of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> Island in the state of New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the end of the building, it was a part of the community, and as the drawings looked at exactly the product done, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get to and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a communication media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and to tell you that there is no single answer to what a library can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and drawings and complex drawings -- and you're no longer a <unk> public who doesn't have seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the <unk> of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find the right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick based on ideas of what a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are going to get to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Florida, Florida, it can also serve to do sports or to <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the united community around that cause, no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion as <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent buildings and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to do them.
Finally, we're not on <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the way to the most successful spaces, local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
He just turned a year and already started walking.
And it does it out of that wonderful way of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body is moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives himself these <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
<unk> all of his friends do this, and my mom tells me I used to do it. And what did I think about doing that?
How do we suddenly be happy with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at online, "I am <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
From what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow school colleagues said, you don't know who to believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, he has received more than 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a healthy healthy teenager, and it gets these answers to one of the most vulnerable life stages of their life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected to a continuous way, so young as young people.
As a mother told me, "It's like a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is <unk> our kids to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments they get.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is actually rigged digitally.
What is the best in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a context every day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of the girls in now.
<unk> <unk> are still <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young young people.
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars, and the singers who are <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to look at it, the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities -- their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think you don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how to match society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates in the classroom, <unk> participating in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call attention for their physical thinking.
One of five aren't going to go at all at all over the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you look good enough, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently <unk> <unk> a smaller note to the average of your fellow partners who don't care about it as well.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it turns out regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be good of course, we are talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem do do less activity in physical activity, eat less fruit and vegetables, involved in more diets.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's because of all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> <unk> surgery, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs a billion dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would it be that we could.
We have this potential for interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are going to not only have a positive impact on a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting points for anyone willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take them together in the issue, and let's be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
<unk> the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you see.
So all of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments we published in our social networks.
We can help people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you question: When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow up to be valuing all of their person, valuing individuality, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you can see that you see that they are never going to be the people who are, or to reach out what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who are in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
A <unk>
It could just be just the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, which would be paid for her to not have a long legs -- <unk> more <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this, and we would give the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk>
But let's give our children the truth.
And so the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and so they do, and because of us and how they make us feel.
<unk> the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of age of age of today, they become insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the five November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense <unk>
By <unk> initially they declared it, but being a prisoner for other charges and the company of others, they started planning with attacks about 12 icons from New York, including <unk> <unk> and the headquarters
Fortunately, those plans was <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be able to stop it.
He later would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with an American <unk> high school school high school.
Only when I was seven years, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam that very few, even most Muslims come to know about.
By the experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to want to wish the same things in life.
However, all of religion, in all human group, there are always a little fraction of people who become so <unk> to their convictions who think that we have to use all the possible means for everyone to live as them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained to me that in the last few weekends, he and some friends, had been going to rush training in Long Island, to practice practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> which, without knowing that our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to point to the target to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that <unk> gave the little orange light on the target and for surprise all, especially my whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
From father, as a son.
And all of the comment gave them a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they seemed so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put a stick with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, that instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always me, the new face of the class was the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white man, but to be the new <unk> and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say, <unk> <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in test my way of thinking, was during the presidential presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National <unk> <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done, friendship, was Jewish age.
I took a number of days out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been made to me to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
By the point, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that many of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it was not easy to me to treat people in the way as I would have had to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is being <unk> but I know what it's going to be shot by something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every night Jon Stewart made me become <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see the race of people, religion or sexual orientation have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that an Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that keeps in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, one day, who is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way -- even though I would join this ideology of violent ideology -- I didn't get to get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism being talking, against those <unk> acts as rejection of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put it here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this moment, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an amazing movie <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has and taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hungry, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that project to your eyes.
And it has constantly a family voice in your conscious thinking.
The heart of the film is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie, you, you and you.
There is nothing that would be more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective there.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would get that vision.
The psychology is studying behavioral behavior -- neuroscience is studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that I filed Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand much better, for example, the brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do in some areas of the brain and what is it <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Don't offend the <unk>
There are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't.
Why is there an internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give the <unk>
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like the <unk> like your life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do we operate the <unk> how <unk> function are adapted and <unk> the living organisms that are all questions about the target work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about, how we speak -- how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why is that all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, doesn't actually have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that I would work for a long time, I would beat my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in <unk> terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we will get rid of this point.
We have a wonderful chain of wonderful explanations -- we have used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know that we are still yet.
With an anomaly like this, you can need some radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> <unk> before we deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Her crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors and it is studies that everything needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely purely <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is natural.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the <unk> of space, and the space and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explaining in terms of any more basic terms.
Rather, it's considered fundamental -- and there is the world.
Sometimes the list of the key <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electromagnetic events in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, dough, mass laws -- so they applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation where we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, dough, mass -- charge, the way for logic -- you have to pay the list.
The most natural thing would be to <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science, right?
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is we need to study fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, the time, the <unk> -- physical processes.
We physicists sometimes say that we want to be fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find the fundamental fundamental laws that we can put in a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans -- dogs mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when he thinks to say, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of feeling <unk> <unk> some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How did anyone think something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and dough, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum to nature.
And one deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that we prescribe thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
There is always information processing, and there's awareness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, as a human being, awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
So a very exciting thing is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be about consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of a form of information integration -- just quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the earthworms, microbes, they particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there is still a different awareness level of scratch.
It actually provides a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be able to leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that put fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I was supposed to eat nothing to have a consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think I would think about this, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its complexity and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problems on the ethic of development of development of smart computers and the ethic of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective pleasure, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, we have a TED consciousness -- an inner movie for this whole group of TED <unk> different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that needs to be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer on the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which of the second is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think eventually we'll find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, one under education.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because he wanted to <unk> for a <unk>
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a gay problem.
She doesn't actually get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What's a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school school in <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the class 11 studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about things like <unk> at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experience with disabled people as <unk> objects.
And we don't think of it, and it's not my boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people, we're there to be there.
And in fact, I'm on this stage and I do what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you, right?  Yes. Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to the disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that the disability is something <unk> -- a capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing, and you can't make it remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or is this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, from the girl without drawing a pen with a pen for his mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with little carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- you know, <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we were giving people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad to be my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that they've been dealing with strange people -- to express that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with disability in benefit from people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
So let's get some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you might think.
They are not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was involved in the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled, because of society where we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the commons.
They are just using their bodies by getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And, honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> from other people with disability all over time.
However, I don't know that I'm rather lucky than them.
<unk> this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the nice trick of how to charge the mobile phone battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that they've sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a load of stairs has never made it to become a <unk>
Never.    <unk> on a television screen will not be going to show the <unk> for the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered <unk> from nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have such low expectations of people with disability that we might be able to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disability, with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at the 11 degree in Melbourne is not a little surprised that your new teacher is a wheelchair.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think you think about what you think about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to do <unk> reality and football football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality changing our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
They will allow you to experience what's going to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried <unk>
I have to use words.
So I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the field of game to 100 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man from 110 pounds -- <unk> trying to <unk> it with everything else.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
And I put some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, and give them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the practice of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology of emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible being <unk>
A moment -- a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go from <unk> how we get it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created, and it's not cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a Russian mountain <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What is the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball on the network?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> the <unk> and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. You give them money.
So, here's a brief design on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> they put a <unk> to his <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios in the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was more quick.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group, and you see your next big thing shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they carry on. You won't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
Just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, they hate <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every single corner of the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people who are below.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information you send to your players.
Good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information <unk>
This is going to take good equipment for guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
<unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> a <unk> of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight would tell you that a defense behind you will go to <unk> usually not <unk> but the <unk> system will <unk>
They went to the protection.
Another <unk> is <unk> that there is a <unk>
<unk> the <unk> but they <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, though, the receptor sees in your bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have followed it from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the game.
So I'll do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally going to be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much this technology is worth of a teacher in the classroom trying to show you a <unk> how bad their actions are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth a gay technology in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is that for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, <unk> reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face -- we feel like the always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I spent the southern tip of the county of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known to its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean -- and its inspiring architectural speech.
Unfortunately, it's also an imam for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer managed to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
suicide from the bridge is no practical and <unk>
But from this openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has become <unk> as such, such as the rest of him releases it from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to do suicide.
After a drop of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The people who don't usually get rid of the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that those who <unk> this method of suicide is to realize the death of the death of the death that are <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches from parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people were before you get to their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its darkest time, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young woman was talking to an expert contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day in bringing it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service at those who were born suicide, but the officers too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train train to the new government ...
This is Jason <unk>
I met him 22 last year when I got a call from a possible guy sitting in the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to the Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to two times before New Jersey were trying to try to kill himself from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and I sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
From she came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just taken your life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had been given it.
<unk> harm damage affect a lot of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it to be <unk>
What do you find?
<unk> what about that?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you need to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels, because they probably don't get it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask ask the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about ending their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to despair, despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing that you can do to <unk> <unk> social isolation, and a missing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January of this year, and he wrote to me this email just a couple of days ago, and he's with her permission and <unk> I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 her father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen it from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be as easy to end up it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of March 2005, I wrote a radio call by a <unk> subject on the sidewalk <unk> near the north wall.
<unk> my bike, and I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed immediately <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the hour and a half ago, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided on his mind that day back on that lane and giving life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, he <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it make you <unk> and give it to hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Little after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to <unk> it.
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events of the March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
He's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly properly <unk>
I heard Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as the says.
We give God for you.
<unk> with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote <unk> <unk> When I visited the General <unk> at San Francisco at night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to get it to <unk>
Now, Kevin is a <unk> father, and the active member of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, give me the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people, or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only about three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls around the bridge.
From those incidents where I've been directly involved with only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
And during that time, I got my hand in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one that leave side to the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to San Francisco, with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be used to do.
suicide can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't, but you know what you are, and you know what you are, and you ask you, how do you get it?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had a dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with me inside.
For complicated reasons, that I'm going to talk to me later, when I look at this picture, I'm thinking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, I'm just starting.
We all shook our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or the beliefs of the ones around us.
They are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my <unk> <unk> my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
They recorded me as <unk> as I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, at my house, I was always wearing this shirt on my head.
And my mom asked myself, "Why do you always take that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never told me to share my story, not because I think it's going to be a bad thing, but because of how the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who tell me as I am.
Many aren't so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage, and I remember this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's a <unk> competition competition competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she died, she got over the cost of <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in the bathroom, won in <unk> <unk> and he had a third finalist between over 40 candidate candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was about queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they went to remote <unk> of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be an queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you give you to America you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also sat at me when I stood in Thailand at the age of five.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand to do the most sophisticated surgeries and secure.
In that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before we change the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document, means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and be model.
Many aren't so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living alive, he lived his truth, but that, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we do a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people who <unk> and stood up with injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and only for me.
I want to do the best to help the others to live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank you all my <unk>
My parents' network, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and sometimes they told me that their parents couldn't take it, I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works. It's not just the identity of gender, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the theme that sometimes that wasn't a block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known to their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known to her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when he took their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National Prize <unk> was made very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we had a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in today's societies, right from the beginning, when when we were born a girl, their birth don't get <unk>
It's not welcome, and by his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her <unk> to the mother and nobody was hitting the father.
And a mother ran a lot to have a child.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, you feel guilty like a criminal.
Not only mother suffering, but the daughter. The daughter <unk> when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you get home and school for her brothers.
Even the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move down the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, he pays out of his house without a male.
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and her brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that honor, honor, could even kill.
And it's interesting that this source of honor, doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> also affecting the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in behalf of the honor.
And there is a larger standard of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and their mother and people's decisions even if they don't will.
If you take a man with a man who doesn't like or if you met it, with a old man has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the very young one, it has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
What happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same chance of honor to her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I was <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my feather, and grabbed my <unk> and I <unk> a line of my name, and wrote, <unk>
And when she went out, when she was four and a half years old, I was sitting in my school.
You might ask, why should I tell you about a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for a young life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when you put the form of a <unk> form and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give her my sisters and his daughters, I thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
They encouraged me to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on her personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught them to the students to forget the lesson called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for the rights of women.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the participation of women in all of the political and economic activities and social.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
They were banned girls to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people that kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got out of the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the slogan of the BBC, he was offered her same for New York Times, and I talked in every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the October of October 2012, he was hit by <unk> in the head.
It was a day for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would love my wife to my wife -- "I have <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please, don't you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of the truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and they were <unk>
Both were on the right path, and God <unk>
These few words were very much <unk> to me, and I didn't get to ask them again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and strong headaches of head because his facial optic was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> on the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never be <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to do good. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16 year-old girl.
<unk> when he doesn't leave his task.
They fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is a special thing in my <unk> who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk> and <unk>
I tell you, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and, from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation,
You are still as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be smart <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the dead of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything else, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> to keep alive.
More than I saved myself for little.
But thankfully, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try and try to get the <unk> dose -- because there really doesn't have a clear map, which says to <unk>
I started to test with different mixtures -- and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the infinite dose, my sense of who I was me, my sense of who I was, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I had a scientific dose and chemicals for a twentieth man, and I was amazed by looking at how I would look at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem that I had in front of it, and it just wasn't going to happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to <unk> Since then I've been better with men.
What I was trying to do is I <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk>
<unk> just to think of pictures, and that became my point of key reference point -- how do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if we were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> as <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, and for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking, <unk>
And so, after several years, I get to find the point right and I have lots of great mental <unk> -- really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director were able to use his imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could get the music of your head?
There is incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative can share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of doing this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, imaging imaging imaging -- to represent the brain here, and here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The column in the middle of the brain shows the brain of that same individual as the same individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right became <unk> the content of the central column on the left. You see the difference is almost <unk>
This was repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into visual visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube videos as they were <unk> their brains to create a big array of reactions in the brain in the video video.
And then I showed you a film with new images and new people, new animals, and as long as they put up a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain data data -- to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This has left us <unk>
We're pretty close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain systems systems of larger resolution systems today, and its resolution as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is open the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't give you that one.
A lot of these are proposing new techniques of projection on images, even by me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we need to ask the following thing, this technology will be the end of the way to work.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger, but at this point, magnets more <unk> only provide small improvements in the resolution, not by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets, let's make better fertility.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and radio radio FM in the MRI systems.
And at a time, instead of a magnetic field -- <unk> magnetic patterns, magnetic patterns, the radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio radio processing, we can increase <unk> the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then divide in layers of our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid -- but the <unk> hormones that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity. This is the dream.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be a <unk> use as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few options more than opening up this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We need to learn how to step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about coming out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay story.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may be telling some person for the first time you love it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have done in life.
All closet closet I'm going to be a hard conversation -- and although our issues can change the experience of having lived and having come out of that closet is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working on the South Side of the <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> -- I don't <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be the slope of the <unk> of my own <unk> and I had <unk> my head -- I was a little bit, I would ask a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear a uncomfortable silence on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit, it would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You are a kid or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues at the table,  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And then he took a deep breath and I went down and went down to my back, a four-year-old dress with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And so I got a profound way on, again, I stood up with him close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a kid, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a little <unk>
I am more than a girl in a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite brother is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all. I just said, "Well, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hardest conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You only know how it feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons for why they come out of my closet was more difficult to get out of their own, but this is the <unk> -- hard is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared <unk> it's harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is more difficult than saying to your three-year-old son who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop <unk> what is hard about what is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security, or at least more security than what the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, are made out of the face -- it's not a place to live in.
Thank you.  Imagine himself.
I, who had a horse, and a <unk> dressed and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child four years that would fit the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my <unk> <unk> and the moving one is just the most scary thing that I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends with whom I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my <unk> launches was more memorable from my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I do my female <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where my parents were my parents, people who were known to get me years back.
And after talking a moment, one of the women company, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in St. Petersburg.
"Well, we've never been there, but we heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> us?
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I would expect to try desperately to support her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally he said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a Russian shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find out and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you will be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that we're going to do.
It's like the hard conversations still remain my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct <unk> just <unk> <unk>
If you know they are gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe you might be gay, they will maintain the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never get rid of it.
And some of them can be wounded who can be injured safe, so they have done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find it in a dark <unk> I'm going to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the history of how intelligence has seen as a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of pioneers <unk> as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I had a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of Earth or neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on the Earth, they would be forced to develop a physics theory that explained how, even a certain moment at the time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying underlying mechanism.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately correlated for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to the development of universal states that are providing the diversity of possible future <unk>
Finally, in a robotic movement, there's been a variety of technical techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, from a number of years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we could extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I've ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force -- F, that acts in order to maximize future freedom to action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices with a force like the diversity of potential future <unk> Yes, it up to an impending imminent time, <unk>
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom and keep our choices open.
And so when you realize this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> it is?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have a trend more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from her?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that can be found inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal tests playing games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without being left to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just as a human standing without <unk> here we see a pole -- automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it to <unk> a goal.
He just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the <unk> model.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where your friends are constantly getting together, and it keeps successful the network right together.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a <unk> strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> actions, successfully increases assets under their exponentially.
This risk of risk risk will have massive applications.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social engagement, all flow of one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of term the term <unk> -- there was always the concept that if you had a smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion that would be <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that perhaps all of these decades -- we've had all of the concept of rebellion in the reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's the other thing, that the urge to take control of all future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals to learn from these kinds of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of them to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial things, to help us understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the rest of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission for NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets of our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint <unk> of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and block a little bit of that light that we go.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
In contrast, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that get out of their own.
At the time, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this treasure of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for a thousand millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have rapidly expanded our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not any scientific scientist or the weather or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newborn planet, and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world that is shown by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> track their surface to search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Business now offers not only short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these <unk> images, they remind us to deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas, and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay by <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and <unk> places on the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> through our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I'm concerned that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag up with a great and sad <unk> and the implication of some that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet, we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
For a lot of me that I like to like the exploration, I am in profound disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the Titanic the Titanic will actually comment on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration <unk> and future preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal to understand and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They are just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in the hostile and <unk> areas -- maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment <unk> the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the <unk> Enrico Fermi asked me to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there was many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life existence until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization of us will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put into hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would get my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had them <unk>
So quickly he tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all very <unk>
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend of Jeff <unk> to pass night because he had a flight early in Europe to the next morning, and I was my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a half a half an night, so I thought, although despite the circumstances, I'm going to stop.
I am a neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases the heart rate -- they will increase the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in their place, that <unk> that were bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen, you know, the probability of which is a complete catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't work.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed I told him I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called the <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Whenever there is a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent the damage to the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some of the things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious thing.
At the house, they would take a place for things that are very easily.
So this sounds like common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our spatial memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where the same is, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the tribes are, where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved very evolved very evolved to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys from the car, <unk> <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook up next to the door, maybe a plate of <unk>
For your passport, a particular arrow.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with that stuff always will be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone, a picture of your credit card card, and a car license, you know, <unk> by mail in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> that can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful things that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions and any kind of decision that you need to take a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that the high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not better, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, and it's even likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for most doctors don't want to talk about, and companies companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the <unk> and if it's God's fault. It's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before it will help someone person?
300.
This is according to the research of the researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently by <unk>
I myself explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack or military stroke or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to go down my <unk>
Why not no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress they don't think clearly.
So you think about how to bring this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out <unk> by the drug that you help help you medicine.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with their physician.
The medical ethic is required, is part of the principle of informed consent.
We have to have access to this kind of information to initiate the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat it is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the largest men in the older men in the middle of the prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat it is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent effects just going to be a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about time for the questions that you can make you go to the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice for many times, they want a smaller life of pain, or a longest life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you are trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> <unk> not necessary the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get the lunch lunch so that nothing that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that are going through the window during those moments of stress is the rational, rational, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we need to <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
And the idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key to the entry door in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a tree of <unk> where you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, and the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over time, he mixed with local signs, and it was developed with the language that we have now known as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize it's not true to nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a brain world, is as if I lived in a foreign country, track their rules, <unk> behaviors and standards without <unk>
So how do I understand that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to the sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned, for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise to eat from the bag of the potato potato bag of <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, they're not <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In the <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines in the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend -- and that was called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
It's going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it in <unk> or I can experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all I had taught me about sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started creating a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency of social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art work, or I could be able to do it.
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me equally and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan with a very high rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to focus on <unk> and not having any social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic medium, it was <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a music note is not able to be capturing and expressing in the paper.
And the same can tell you about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide in many different parameters -- different different.
If you <unk> a different parameter for every finger as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so, while the piano is on the piano, English is a linear language, as if you get <unk> just once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 <unk> fingers to express a concept, or idea of <unk>
If only one shift would change the chord would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters -- <unk> can be to express different ideas.
So for example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it could be a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is <unk>
If you get it, and we <unk> the speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be called <unk> <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time expresses time in <unk> and how the distance in the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is more close to and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite -- with a very romantic and dramatic idea at once, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think it automatically <unk> at the same time."
Watch <unk> right right, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to teach you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of the hands.
Now we're going to do it in my head as well as the chest -- something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> the same time."
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third thing, please, <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> and you don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich treasure trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to <unk> your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble bubble to say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they are not very good to clean other people's others.
The time is now adult and taught and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot to wait for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage.
So as good citizens, they cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but now over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect these plastic pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it's very risky to use those huge boat.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you the kids who treat electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting plastic pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
And by using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids are going to have a lot with robots.
Then we started very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And then we turned lights and web cameras into garages, and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the plastic pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an image of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this step step in a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I was looking at my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very well.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it <unk> with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is going on, where the water where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil are also in brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can lead through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what in the water.
We had this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further away, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and even closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he had a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> ate several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, according to the average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and the many people, of course, has safe and blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and perform independent with other scientists, the land, the ground, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course I don't have the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks
It might seem that they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Along with them, we discussed that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data in the <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> estimate.
But based on this, we organized an civil expedition -- the nearest <unk> to date.
We get up to 1.5 miles of the nuclear station, and with the aid of the <unk> of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking device as we invented and built.
Here's a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of so small so we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we convert it into the larger space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal -- chemistry, a little bit of biology, of fibers, you can basically build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with aid aid, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked, we can invent things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the elderly population transforming their standard wheels in new self-driving cars.
<unk> oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientific citizens, creators -- we must prepare for the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of steel, the other one of a single silk thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is a <unk> on the environment, the other thing I thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fight for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that was required by every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects like <unk> from different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> pore.
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality by the variation of <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the <unk> the <unk> of every designer and an architect at the time between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between the assembly and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, analytics and breast, is shown in the two screens behind me.
My job at the most simple level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, move away from assembly and approaching growth.
I'm probably asking, Why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where you have four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, of a big scale, like this robotic arm with a span of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base that someday not very far to print <unk> buildings and graphics <unk> that glow in the dark.
So here we have <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every single aperture is <unk> to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion <unk> <unk> <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This hull combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CT scanner, <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments that it allows you to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the beginning, comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
Professor Carter came back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> surface pattern, it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not by the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material in the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious, but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends up the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there was no difference between trunk, and branches, leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made the trees growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made of place.
I often wonder, "What would the design would be if objects were made of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material to get the kind of material in the tree of the tree <unk> with fruits, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> and we produced <unk> and produced <unk>
We were able to do the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material about the gait and create these structures made of a single three feet long, 100 percent.
When the parts are ready, you dry them to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process they used to contain <unk> <unk> which first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT -- the bacteria designed genetically to capture very quickly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> <unk> and if it broadens even more windows.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed for <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, they'll be able to grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals that are going to be formed, new biological segments inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops -- <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> <unk>
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other blood drops and produces biofuels for the built environment.
But these two journeys don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
So to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the <unk> tract that will help you build these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function of path.
So we started making those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk> functionality.
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> more transparent.
So this digestive system is <unk> when it stretches from one end to another, it will be 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our very thin.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels bright channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are middle-aged days, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> tissue tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer built material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture of a home in which it was <unk>
<unk> will not be about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers into each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm is actually turned into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm of silk.
However, when the silk worm put in a flat patch on a flat patch not within a box, we realized that <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the form, the composition, the <unk> structure will be transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are going to death up to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We had to see that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk thing without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing <unk> and we put in our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms go into more dark and more dark areas that we used to use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light, and the heat, is actually <unk> silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We asked <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to get them with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is great integrity, and he was right.
When there's biological silk on silk -- <unk> <unk> which is the entire pavilion of our integrity.
And just over two or three weeks, <unk> worms <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings that are around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers should bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of design, which demands us for the first time that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age had when they asked them for the first time this?
They can get your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English -- the <unk> and the art and the art and the online sites -- in addition, playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And usually I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to move it out.
But then I came up with something else, something totally different, and I would get rid of it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to move it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I was not sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something bad about me -- no longer <unk> at all.
I was worried about being a fear of engagement, or to be obese, or to <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to ask you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> it, they learned from culture.
The first question: "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to provoke nice answers into children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is about us and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask you to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's about being the cute exercise of before what the dream.
Why?
While this question inspires kids to dream with what they might be, doesn't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adult adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> editor at <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there's a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And feel something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so on.
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
In the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as <unk> or woe that you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in world, visualization of data, visualizing mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
There comes new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning quickly.
When we <unk> we are interested in something, we go to it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> of full time and a <unk>
As a girl pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he turned to a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales <unk> when they started their thumb, and this ability to write a really compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is a waste of time to be a waste of time to be able to do what you would be able to do is even if you end it down.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is the adaptability. That is to say, the ability to transform everything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other designer designer from website, sometimes a professor at Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of his customers.
<unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the market needs -- which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a site and a <unk> <unk>
The teacher can dive deep up and put some ideas, and the <unk> provides a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going on with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a lot of them are told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope to be this: <unk> with the internal wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart bill -- then, <unk> all over the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, we will save the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until that, unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange plate and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If we had to have been alive today, we could not give her to her more aid than the fact that he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> lots of treatments for cancer cancer, to HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million all over the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of the two.
In other words, there is the probability of the chance you spend their <unk> <unk> or helping to take care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
Just in the U.S., Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs to increase a rise of five times in 2050, by 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more year in cancer cancer that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's disease and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, we all know, even scientists, <unk> <unk> with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy old brain compared to the <unk> patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory loss and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly -- life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. <unk> found plate and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We know now that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> <unk> end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some of the dots, they stay in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
So you have to find the right step that we would understand, and then create a drug that is it.
Until recently, most of the wires have reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, engineers, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'm going to show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
So let's look at a few videos of what happened when these drugs were doing in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that beat each other inside them, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they are going to live and live a normal life.
This is just an initial result -- but research as this shows Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to assume that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we will, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward in HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the wounded victims of their loved ones and day and night, are often too often <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's isn't in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times, the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The paper is a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience in the laboratory, I was one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will become <unk> to make 36 questions increasingly and more personal and then they both look at the eyes without the four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or a skill, which would be?
Number one: When was it the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
We <unk> these are getting more and more personal.
Number two: <unk> really <unk> <unk> to your partner what you like from him, or it would like it to her, I know this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you have ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me -- the extent that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance of testing this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and -- and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column in a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably ask, they still keep them together.
And the reason I think is the question of this is because I've done this question over and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the issue.
A week before the paper was publishing the article was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had tried to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But one blog input can get a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just about my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would have probably a few thousand views.
And that came across a relatively new relationship.
But as I gave it no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and already Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've been called the "Today <unk> and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million pages, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing with <unk> on your own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they were always, the same question: the same question: <unk> still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and <unk> and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately set out red.
I think this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't ready for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for Saint <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both did to do a public emergence together.
We had a TV interviews, and we would give the orders of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the iconic icons of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce <unk> love -- not just an adventure, but love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, mostly the wrong question.
How do you know if you were to <unk> together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same record in 1997. And there the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, he was looking for interpersonal to interpersonal to <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But I study it worked.
The participants felt closer to doing that, several later studies, they also used animal protocol -- as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people from the political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I set up last summer, and that combines personal questions with four new eye contact, it was <unk> in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you tell you about the person who you do it.
Well, he did a break.
I think she only wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after testing the research.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and was a really difficult separation to me.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to virtually all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took to the science.
And so I did all I was able to find out the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could be a certain way -- the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just worked for the book that I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met the mind of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I used as I felt then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in a way or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand than I think.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than what I can always demand for me.
What I'm looking for love is an assurance -- not just to be <unk> today, and it's going to be <unk> tomorrow, but it's going to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a short shot.
There may be a way to make some way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love in love with us feeling beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story is, keep together?
And your content with an answer of S or No.
So more than a question, let's ask you to ask questions harder questions, like, "How do you decide who to deserve your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year, a known year, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still getting together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love in love -- it's not the same as remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- I mean, love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
He didn't think how many times would you have to make that decision, and how much time I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing if he always wanted to choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answered, <unk> have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and having to have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to convert my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really believe it.
And what we did, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the final happy implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love somebody, and the hope that he also loved me, and it's frightening, but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of lesbian in full <unk> and in a way, I became like a forest <unk>
<unk> New York City a time ago.  One thing that really affected me but more detail later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he took a dollar bill -- a pen ticket and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment because he was in <unk> <unk> like to go to trip and make <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, I covered it and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking he could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite: in a way it seemed that it turned out of size, as if it was that they would take the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
And this time, I started to add electronic elements, they found strange bottles of bottles out of the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
Can I flow <unk> drawing just like it does about a <unk> in the scene of the crime.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strange creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I got interested in human form, sculptures of resin with drawings of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing, I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar to the drawing on a window and then on another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together, and it had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, which I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a big measure in "The garden of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the <unk> of <unk> to this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
So here is where creatures with animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird <unk> tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
And anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out of the clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a little narrative.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out this <unk>
It also has a half feet long a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail has a fire <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye <unk> made of suicide cards in 1986.
<unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball <unk>
<unk> <unk>  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 or 12 at the time.
They are kind of like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest -- you can <unk> the <unk>
I'm going to come up with the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest and he covers the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't do it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
They can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
And within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a musician, one writer, a <unk> a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
And we would see the box and all the people in it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we get to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of borders, of religion, don't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and the same box.
And if we didn't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill actually got against pain, first passes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
And I'll take a pill that is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug <unk> effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients.
When they take drugs that are <unk> they use them to decrease the number of viruses in blood, and increase the cancer cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in their negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the blood of your blood and worse, and even worse for the time they take their destiny, which is where it's most important -- in the HIV warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily in the blood stream of patients who are attached to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life for run by <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the wounds and diabetes surgery, you can be used for anything <unk> including <unk> transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill out of extremely small holes, which open and close, almost the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How did that be?
We sent a little laser beam on the cellular membrane on HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of farmers.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or plates <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> in the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, you go to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, which releases it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is using new to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups that are not <unk> and armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
And so what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to the confrontation of a nonviolent interest.
I do a field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peacekeeping deals between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do we do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they were trying to figure out how they do, but nobody analyzes what they do when you don't have it.
The armed struggle and political struggle <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
Since his creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a social services network and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known for his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking things.
<unk> a complex machinery of communication, radio stations on TV, web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but by using business -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also make something else more strong ties to their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they build hospitals, they run in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
<unk> groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn out by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling a empty, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they filled with gaps <unk> by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in the violent struggle with governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are these organizations, less we can <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory, running all of their functions, collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of the nations with no state and hybrids and the more weak the states, as in the Middle East, more <unk> and fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the tools of the military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand groups better -- we'll better understand what incentive to offer to foster transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, military power can win some <unk> but not to give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security, to fill that vacuum of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a woman as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the tag of <unk> would be unfair to <unk>
I'm a feminist, but it's pretty bad.
And therefore I would feel like a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The bad <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people in the <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and unpleasant word.
I was amazed as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's the same or a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, guardians and also proud of it to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They put the same attention for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as it would be free of harassing or violence.
We have right to use <unk> and accessible the contraceptives and the services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression gender, religion and our social condition and our social condition and a lot more.
We need to look at these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music by <unk>
Although the letter degrades women and offends women, the classic <unk> the classic <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is amazing.
He actually had your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical thinking.
I believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and beautiful things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> of <unk> stories that get true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I got that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color, the gay workers, the gay workers, the gay workers, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist person.
It also happens the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that they were going to do perfection.
When we were <unk> they were very happy from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already think about that <unk> before you try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear of what it means that <unk> <unk> not being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Take an example of <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
Over the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> three feet tall.
It was a show <unk> seeing this star of pop embrace openly feminism and making the women and the young men who be a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless arguments when <unk> was or not just a feminist.
They were able to save his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need a lot.
We go so much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there was nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or more <unk> one is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it to action and be a little <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they were to <unk> the change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions do it justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about my three-year-old and four years.
They are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright and too brave. I want you to grow up in a world.
So where they were told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice to become a much easier thing to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is treating the sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treating women than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes are treating their fellow as <unk>
In any case, men, especially men white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, participating in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to do it to be including even more like us to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision choices.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of courage and hope that our decisions are going to the top, to people in the power of directors and movie producers and music and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions and significant change.
We can also say with bravery our feminism, -- good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not going to be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I mean, especially because of all, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was a incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids were excited to me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was not anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, also found that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I actually hold the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad boy. I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we could all do the same.
I hope that we could all be a little bit courageous, when you need it to be a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the remarkable things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with a immune immune system, is one of the most easily infectious diseases in the world.
There is a effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the paper that unleashed the argument about autism and the vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being a <unk> fraud by British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know that, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines are putting into danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her creating their own professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates are stable just three or four children per 10,000 dollars.
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are routinely refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could give them from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Centers for Disease Control, what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the <unk> criteria had to be able to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how he discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global health world.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinic.
This second story tells us everything about how we came here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed <unk> <unk> worlds -- <unk> the people around it, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their faces, but they were prey from panic by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of syndrome as we were <unk> references as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, we would have to give that diagnosis to children, but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once he realized that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to her office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood <unk> caused by cold parents, and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't be <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the children in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the kids were simply giving up what they had heard their parents who were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children, were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, which researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> scientific psychologist in London, thought that the theory of the mentor mothers of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband is John <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed <unk> without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend at the National National Marine <unk> that they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try and find autistic kids in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the fact of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse and diverse people.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit in beautiful pictures, and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article -- and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> talked German, and he would take him for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching kids with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and the kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of autism causing autism, Asperger's described as disability as disability for life that required <unk> forms of support and spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating the children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called her their little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education that were especially suitable for them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse diverse variety that saves a amazing variety of <unk> and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic were common and they have always been, and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an act of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> so the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria in the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> by the limited model of <unk> by a wide and Asperger model.
These changes weren't in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked with <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and fathers all knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy medical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I should not have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a web effect, a perfect storm of consciousness autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were actually hoping that it was -- so that the people with autism and their families finally <unk> support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics.  A simple <unk> and <unk> story credible as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart of prevention that one out of 68 children in America are in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are puzzles by solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
Certainly autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> <unk> who believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding the teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, communities, support communities, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on deck and <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we moved into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a <unk>
Thank you.
