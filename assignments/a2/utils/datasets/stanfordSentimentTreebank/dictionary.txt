, it 's just another sports drama\/character study .|221408

, it 's low-cal Woody at best .|142270
, it 's mission accomplished|102626

, it 's neither .|142272
, it 's no classic|62014

, it 's not as pathetic as The Animal .|180723
, it 's not as single-minded as John Carpenter 's original|43626
, it 's not half-bad .|221411
, it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .|142273
, it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .|142274
, it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding .|18427
, it 's not that big a deal|142275
, it 's not too bad .|102627

, it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .|102631
, it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .|142277
, it 's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .|18428
, it 's perfect .|221414
, it 's perfect . It 's also the year 's sweetest movie .|23710
, it 's pleasant enough|102632
, it 's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome .|221415
, it 's pretty but dumb .|180724
, it 's pretty enjoyable|62016
, it 's pretty stupid .|221416
, it 's pretty stupid . I had more fun with Ben Stiller 's Zoolander , which I thought was rather clever . But there 's plenty to offend everyone ...|102633
, it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie|102634
, it 's quite fun in places|62017
, it 's quite fun in places .|221417
, it 's really just another Major League .|102635
, it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .|180725
, it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken|142278
, it 's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form 's history .|23711
, it 's significant without being overstated .|13602
, it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .|142279
, it 's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days .|43627
, it 's still a guilty pleasure to watch .|102636

, it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part|43628
, it 's still a sweet , even delectable diversion .|62018
, it 's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-Saving Private Ryan tributes to the greatest generation .|23712
, it 's still entertaining to watch the target practice .|102637
, it 's still not a good movie|102638
, it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .|102639
, it 's still unusually crafty and intelligent for Hollywood horror .|102640
, it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .|142281
, it 's thanks to Huston 's revelatory performance .|62019
, it 's that nothing can change while physical and psychological barriers keep the sides from speaking even one word to each other .|62020
, it 's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .|142282
, it 's the best sequel since The Empire Strikes Back ... a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth .|43629
, it 's the man that makes the clothes .|180726
, it 's the repetition of said behavior|221418
, it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .|142283
, it 's the tension that keeps you in your seat|23713
, it 's the very definition of epic adventure .|102641
, it 's the worst movie I 've seen this summer|102642
, it 's too long and unfocused|43630
, it 's too long and unfocused .|221419
, it 's very much like life itself .|62021
, it 's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon .|102643
, it 's well worth a rental .|102644
, it 's worth checking out for the performances alone .|23714
, it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough|142284
, it actually hurts to watch .|180727
, it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed .|62022
, it ai n't half-bad .|62023
, it already has one strike against it .|102645
, it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who are n't .|62024
, it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .|62025
, it also represents glossy Hollywood at its laziest .|180728
, it appears that ( Jackie ) Chan 's US influence is starting to show in his Hong Kong films .|23715
, it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren .|23716
, it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .|142285
, it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against|142286
, it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing|23717
, it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .|221420
, it can easily worm its way into your heart . '|102646
, it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .|180729
, it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .|180730
, it certainly got lost in the '' soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .|102647
, it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .|221421
, it collapses like an overcooked soufflé .|180731
, it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh .|102648
, it comes to life in the performances .|62026
, it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .|142287
, it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .|180732
, it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .|142288
, it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie|180733
, it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .|180734
, it created whole new levels of ugly .|142289
, it creeped me out just fine .|23718
, it delivers the same message as Jiri Menzel 's Closely Watched Trains and Danis Tanovic 's No Man 's Land .|43631
, it demands repeated viewings .|23719
, it demonstrates that Werner Herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken .|62027
, it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later .|62028
, it deserves a wide audience .|23720
, it dives into soapy bathos .|142290
, it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds|102649
, it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .|180735
, it does give exposure to some talented performers|62029
, it does go on forever .|142291
, it does n't disappoint .|62030
, it does n't even seem like she tried .|221422
, it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .|180736
, it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks|142292
, it does n't make for completely empty entertainment|62031
, it does n't work .|180737
, it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you .|142293
, it does not alienate either gender in the audience|43632
, it does so without compromising that complexity .|62032
, it drags|180738
, it drowns out the lousy dialogue .|142294
, it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities|62033
, it ends up being , like ( Seinfeld 's ) revered TV show , about pretty much nothing .|142295
, it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay|142296
, it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .|180739
, it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .|142297
, it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .|142298
, it feels more forced than usual .|102650
, it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .|102651
, it finds a new way to surprise and amuse .|13603
, it finds a nice rhythm .|62034
, it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior ,|13604
, it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .|13605
, it gets a full theatrical release|180740
, it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .|142299
, it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental .|23721
, it gets to you .|221423
, it gets to you . Just like Igby .|102652
, it has a genuine dramatic impact|62035
, it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films .|62036

, it is an engaging nostalgia piece .|102656
, it is as seductive as it is haunting .|43634
, it is clearly a good thing .|43635
, it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .|102657
, it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles .|62042
, it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times .|43636
, it is just about right|23722
, it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .|142301
, it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .|102658
, it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .|102659
, it is n't even all that dumb|23723
, it is n't much fun|142302
, it is n't much fun .|221430
, it is nevertheless maintained throughout|62043

, it is not|23724

, it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more|102660
, it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more .|221432
, it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .|180744

, it is still ultimately very satisfying .|221433
, it is still ultimately very satisfying . Think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .|18429
, it is twice as bestial but half as funny .|180745

, it just seems like it does .|221437
, it just seems like it does . My only wish is that Celebi could take me back to a time before I saw this movie and I could just skip it .|102662
, it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .|180746
, it lacks grandeur|13606
, it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with Stevenson 's tale as well as with earlier Disney efforts .|221438
, it looks like Woo 's a P . O . W .|180747

, it makes up for with a great , fiery passion .|62045
, it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust .|102663

, it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .|142307
, it never seems fresh and vital .|102667
, it never seems fresh and vital . It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . It labours as storytelling .|102668
, it never took off and always seemed static .|13607
, it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material .|62051

, it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us|102669
, it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us .|221444
, it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding .|23726
, it offers hope|62052
, it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .|102670
, it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama|62053
, it ponders the reasons we need stories so much .|13608
, it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises|221445
, it probably wo n't have you swinging from the trees hooting it 's praises , but it 's definitely worth taking a look .|62054
, it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .|180752
, it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .|142309
, it puts far more polished documentaries to shame .|23727
, it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .|142310
, it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it|43638
, it really won my heart|102671
, it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end|102672
, it remains depressingly prosaic and dull|142311
, it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .|142312
, it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway .|62055
, it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment .|102673
, it runs for 170|102674
, it seems to lack substance|142313
, it seems to lack substance .|221446
, it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .|62056
, it should pay reparations to viewers .|180753
, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .|102675
, it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .|180754
, it stays in formula -- which is a waste of De Niro , McDormand and the other good actors in the cast|102676
, it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story .|43639
, it still cuts all the way down to broken bone .|102677
, it still feels somewhat unfinished .|102678
, it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion|62057
, it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work .|43640
, it still seems endless|180755
, it still seems endless .|221447
, it still works|102679
, it still works .|221448
, it succeeds .|62058
, it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system .|102680
, it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .|142314
, it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist Byatt .|23728
, it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .|180756
, it surprised me how much pleasure I had watching McGrath 's version .|23729
, it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .|23730
, it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .|142315
, it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives Hollywood .|23731
, it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .|62059
, it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence|180757
, it throws you for a loop .|43641
, it too is a bomb .|180758
, it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .|180759
, it turns the stomach .|180760
, it ultimately comes off as a pale successor .|62060
, it ultimately delivers|43642
, it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .|102681
, it was just a matter of ` eh . '|180761
, it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .|180762
, it will be well worth your time .|62061
, it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .|62062
, it will never hold a candle to the original|142316
, it will probably be a talky bore .|180763
, it will remind them that Hong Kong action cinema is still alive and kicking .|102682
, it wins you over|23732
, it wins you over .|23733
, it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera .|62063
, it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see|142317
, it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .|180764
, it would be a page-turner|13609
, it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .|142318
, it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .|221449
, it would fail and perhaps explode|23734
, it would fit Chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .|102683
, it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .|221450
, it would have been better off dead .|142319
, it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .|142320
, it would have been groundbreaking .|142321
, it would have been groundbreaking . Now it 's just tired .|142322
, it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head|221451
, it would still be beyond comprehension|180765
, its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial .|18430
, its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .|180766
, its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .|180767
, its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves .|43643
, its claws dig surprisingly deep|23735
, its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .|180768
, its determined stylishness|23736
, its difficult these days to appreciate Fire 's bright side .|221452
, its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before .|102684
, its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary ...|62064
, its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it .|23737
, its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .|142323
, its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .|142324
, its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a Jules and Jim for the new millennium .|18431
, its script , and Weaver 's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance|23738
, its shortness disappoints|62065
, its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .|142325
, its story was making no sense at all|180769
, its surprises limp|180770
, its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .|102685
, its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier|102686
, its true colors come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes .|180771
, its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous .|102687
, its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at .|13610

But if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked .|222754
But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .|222755
But in Imax 3-D , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .|13924
But in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .|24910

But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .|222814

I enjoyed it just as much !|223793
I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .|184653
I enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .|18951
I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater|184654
I ever saw that was written down|184655
I expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director Bruce McCulloch .|223794

I feel better already .|66151
I feel sorry for Madonna .|146053
I felt disrespected .|184658
I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .|146054
I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .|146055
I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .|106447

I for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill|66153
I found The Ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .|45570
I found What Time|223796
I found What Time ? to be more engaging on an emotional level , funnier , and on the whole less detached|106448
I found it intriguing , bizarre , Dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way|45571
I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .|146056
I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .|184661
I found it weirdly appealing|66154
I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .|146057
I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say|146058
I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say ,|146059
I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .|146060
I found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as Vincent became more and more abhorrent .|106449
I found myself howling more than cringing|106450
I found myself liking the film , though in this case one man 's treasure could prove to be another man 's garbage .|66155
I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .|146061
I found myself strangely moved by even the corniest and most hackneyed contrivances .|66156
I found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive '' missing thing . ''|45572

I get this much syrup|146064

I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) .|184663
I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .|184664

It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .|185051
It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .|146436
It 's all pretty tame .|106829
It 's all pretty tame . The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .|106830
It 's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage .|66521
It 's all surface psychodramatics .|185052
It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .|146437
It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .|185053
It 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-Soviet Russia .|18993
It 's also , clearly , great fun .|25739
It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .|185054

It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .|146442
It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .|106831
It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .|146443

It 's always fascinating to watch Marker the essayist at work .|66522
It 's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the Marks family .|18994
It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .|106833
It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .|106834

It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .|146447
It 's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that 's often written off as indie film naturalism .|146448
It 's as close as we 'll ever come to looking through a photographer 's viewfinder as he works .|25742
It 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .|146449
